ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION
==============================

What Is Alternative Dispute Resolution?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alternative dispute resolution, or ADR, refers to a range of procedures
for resolving disputes between parties **outside of the traditional
court system**. These include:

+------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

The various ADR procedures range from non-evaluative, informal methods
such as conciliation and facilitation to more evaluative and formal
mechanisms such as arbitration and neutral evaluation.

Arbitration

Arbitration is a consensual process by which parties submit their
differences to one or more impartial persons, the arbitrator or panel of
arbitrators, for resolution through a final and binding decision.

Below are some of the key features of arbitration:

**Confidentiality:** While similar to court litigation in that
proceedings are adversarial and decisions are binding, arbitration
offers a high degree of confidentiality to parties (the proceedings are
private), more flexibility in terms of rules and procedures used as well
as greater international enforceability of judgements over court
decisions.

Under the New York Convention to which Singapore is a signatory,
arbitral awards have extra-territorial enforceability in over 120
countries.

**Time and cost saving:** Resolving disputes through arbitration instead
of litigation can sometimes save time and money for the parties
involved, as arbitral proceedings can in certain cases be faster and
more cost-efficient.

The characteristics of arbitration make it particularly suited for
commercial disputes, especially where confidentiality is important to
the parties involved. Almost every civil dispute can be referred to
arbitration.

However matters involving moral questions or questions of law cannot be
resolved by arbitration. Matters not referred to arbitration include:

(a) Matrimonial matters, like divorce or maintenance.

(b) Bankruptcy matters, eg. declaring a person as an insolvent.

(c) Criminal offences.

    Mediation

    Mediation is a non-adversarial consensual process in which a neutral
    person, the mediator, helps parties to settle their disputes through
    a conciliatory process of discussion and narrowing differences.

    Parties in mediations make their own decisions, with the help of the
    mediator in shaping the outcome of the dispute. The mediator does
    **not** have the final decision-making power. Should parties fail to
    come to an agreement, they are permitted to walk away from the
    mediation session without a positive outcome. Successful mediation
    depends on the co-operation of all parties in implementing the
    agreed upon solution, since the process (unlike arbitration) is
    non-binding unless the parties agree to be contractually bound by
    the terms of settlement.

    The focus in mediation is on finding a practical solution acceptable
    to all parties that helps to preserve the working relationship on
    all sides.

    Adjudication

    Adjudication is similar to arbitration, although there is a set
    timeframe within which the adjudicator must make a decision and
    parties are responsible for their own costs unless otherwise agreed.
    Decisions made in adjudication, as for arbitration, are binding
    unless these are later overturned by an arbitration or court
    judgment.

    Commonly used in the construction industry to ensure payment and
    resolve other types of disputes, adjudication is aimed at being
    faster and more cost effective than either litigation or
    arbitration.

    In general, the flexible nature of ADR and the various options
    available allows parties to choose the most appropriate way for
    resolving their disputes without unnecessary cost or delay.

    Neutral Evaluation

    This is a structured proceeding, but conducted informally. Both
    parties and their lawyers present their side of the case and key
    evidence to one another and the evaluator, who is a settlement
    judge.

    The evaluator then reviews the case and provides an assessment of
    the merits, which is his best estimate of the parties' likelihood of
    success at trial.

    Neutral evaluation can be used to either settle, or as a basis for
    settlement of negotiations.

    Settlement Conferences

    These are meetings in which a judge or volunteer attorney assists
    opposing parties, to reach a mutually agreeable resolution of their
    dispute without having to proceed to a trial. The judge will
    evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of the case, without making
    any decisions or orders in the case.

    Such a conference may be initiated through either party, or it may
    be ordered by the court as a precedent to holding a trial. Parties
    are usually represented at the settlement conference by their own
    lawyers.

    Alternative Dispute Resolution in Singapore

    The following section provides an overview of various ADR services
    available in Singapore to businesses and individuals.

General Commercial Disputes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**A. Mediation**

**Singapore Mediation Centre (SMC)**

Services provided by the SMC include Mediation, Neutral Evaluation,
Mediation-Arbitration ("Med-Arb") and the Singapore Domain Name dispute
resolution. Online ADR services are also available through the dispute
manager website (see section on online ADR below).

The SMC also administers the Small Case Commercial Mediation Scheme
(SCCMS), which is designed to provide cheap mediation services for cases
where the quantum of a claim is S$60,000 or less. The first two hours of
mediation are free.

Its panel of mediators and neutrals includes leaders from different
professions and industries who have undergone formal mediation training
and rigorous evaluation. SMC also has an international panel of
mediators that parties may choose from.

Fees depend on the quantum in dispute and the seniority and number of
mediators.

The SMC can be found at -

1 Supreme Court Lane, Level 4, Singapore 178879

Tel +65 6332 4366

Fax +65 6333 5085

**Mediation in the State Courts**

State Courts attempt to provide a holistic approach to dispute
resolution, including mediation, in a variety of matters -

1. **Criminal matters** - After the complainant files a summons, a
   notice may be issued for both the complainant and respondent to
   appear for mediation before a Magistrate or in the Community
   Mediation Centre.

2. **Small Claims Tribunals** - Generally, claims less than $10,000 are
   heard here. Parties normally comprise consumer and supplier, and are
   asked to attend a mediation or “consultation” session before a Small
   Claims Tribunals Registrar.

3. **Other civil matters** - Other civil disputes may be referred for
   mediation by the Primary Dispute Resolution Centre (PDRC), please see
   below for further details. The PDRC will only schedule a mediation
   session when all the pleadings – all documents required to commence
   an action or defend a case – have been filed and all the parties
   consent to the mediation.

   If the case is a non-injury motor accident (NIMA) or personal injury
   (PI), a notice to attend Court Dispute Resolution will be sent to
   your lawyer.

   If the case is not NIMA or PI, then either party may apply for
   mediation after obtaining permission of all parties.

4. **Family matters** - Parties involved in divorce proceedings in the
   Family Court may be referred for mediation in the Family Resolutions
   Chambers or the Child Focused Resolution Centre. Mediation is also
   conducted by the Maintenance Mediation Chambers when parties file
   maintenance complaints.

   *What Goes on During Mediation at the PDRC*

   **Ad Hoc Mediation**

   Parties can also arrange, for a fee, an *ad hoc* mediation through
   law firms or various other private service providers. These mediators
   will facilitate discussions between the parties to facilitate
   settlement.

   **B. Arbitration**

   **Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC)**

   SIAC is an arbitral institution that offers a neutral and independent
   venue for parties to resolve their disputes. Its services include
   arbitrator appointment and case administration (including financial
   management, logistical and institutional support) to parties involved
   in commercial disputes, both domestic and international.

   With the exception of criminal and family law matters, almost any
   civil case that can be taken to court can be resolved by arbitration
   at SIAC if the parties agree. Fees charged for arbitration include a
   management fee pegged to the amount in the dispute as well as the
   arbitrator's fee, which depends on the complexity and quantum of the
   dispute as well as the seniority of the arbitrators.

   SIAC has a regional panel and an international panel of arbitrators,
   comprising of legal and industry experts in a broad range of subject
   areas. Parties are also free to appoint their own arbitrators if they
   prefer.

   **Other Arbitration Rules / Ad Hoc Arbitration**

   Parties may also agree to arbitrate in Singapore in *ad hoc*
   arbitrations or under other arbitration rules such as the ICC rules
   or UNCITRAL rules. Where parties do not use an arbitration
   institution to administer the arbitration, they will be responsible
   for organizing the arbitration.

   Where arbitration is conducted in Singapore, the Arbitration Act
   (where all the parties are domestic) and the International
   Arbitration Act (all other arbitrations) will apply.

   **Arbitration For Small Cases**

   **Small Claims Tribunal (SCT)**

   The Small Claims Tribunals was established to provide a quick and
   inexpensive forum for the resolution of small claims between
   consumers and suppliers. Claims brought before the tribunals first go
   through mediation to try to reach a settlement, failing which
   adjudication is used to resolve the dispute.

   Small Claims Tribunal can hear only (i) matters less than $10,000; or
   (ii) matters between $10,000 and $20,000, but only if all parties
   signed a memorandum of consent to have the matter heard at the SCT.

   **Law Society Arbitration Scheme (LSAS)**

   The LSAS offers neutral evaluation and arbitration services under a
   simple procedure designed to achieve a speedy resolution at low cost.

   Arbitrations with a sum in dispute of less than S$60,000 are
   ‘documents-only’ arbitrations without an oral hearing, by default,
   unless parties opt otherwise. Costs are limited to 10% of claim value
   or S$2,000, whichever is higher. A scale for party and party costs
   also applies.

   **Pro Bono Arbitration Scheme (PBAS)**

   This scheme is similarly managed by the Law Society. The PBAS is only
   for disputes of up to $20,000, and arbitrations are conducted on a
   documents-only basis.

   There is a sole arbitrator, who will waive his or her fees for the
   matter.

Industry-Specific ADR Schemes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Construction - BCA-SMC Adjudication Initiative**

The Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment (SOP) Act was
introduced with the objective of facilitating cash flow in the
construction industry by upholding the rights of parties to seek
progress payment for work done, and providing a framework for quick and
low-cost resolution of payment disputes through adjudication. The Act
applies to all parties in the construction industry with written
contracts for the works or the supply of goods or services for
construction projects in Singapore.

The Singapore Mediation Centre (SMC) has been appointed as the
Authorised Nominating Body or ANB under the Act and is tasked with
administering the adjudication process as well as train, certify and
maintain a register of adjudicators.

**Maritime - Singapore Chamber of Maritime Arbitration (SCMA)**

The SCMA offers parties involved in maritime disputes an independent,
efficient and reliable means of resolving their disputes through
arbitration. SCMA has an international panel of experienced arbitrators,
user-friendly arbitration rules and a quantum-based fee structure which

   **For Disputes Between Law Practices – SCMediate**

   Senior Counsel in private practice (known as the Forum of Senior
   Counsel) have decided to make themselves available to mediate
   disputes between law practices. Under this service, every Senior
   Counsel in private practice will be available, if requested, to act
   as a mediator in any dispute between law practices. The Senior
   Counsel providing this service will not charge where the total time
   spent does not exceed half a day. However, their availability to act
   will be subject to their prior or overriding commitments. All
   communications with Senior Counsel as mediator will be kept
   confidential. Senior Counsel will render their services on the basis
   that they will be exempted from liability in respect of the services
   provided. As with all mediations, Senior Counsel will not have any
   power to make binding decisions.

   Parties may appoint a mutually agreed Senior Counsel of their choice
   as mediator.

   This scheme is different from the Cost Dispute Resolve scheme offered
   by the society for resolving disputes on legal costs.

Social, Community & Relational Disputes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Community Mediation Centres (CMCs)**

The purpose of the CMC is to provide mediation services in social,
community or family disputes that do not involve a seizable offence
(where police are legally empowered to arrest without a warrant).

CMCs handle cases involving conflicts between neighbours, family members
and friends. CMCs cater to community disputes as opposed to commercial
ones. These encompass relational disputes encountered within one's
community and social sphere. Parties to:

-  Neighbourhood disputes

-  Family disputes (excluding family violence)

-  Disagreements with friends

-  Stallholder/owner squabbles and

-  Altercations/arguments between strangers

   can approach the Community Mediation Centres. Staff will evaluate the
   suitability of each case for mediation.

   Apart from direct intake cases, the CMCs also handle Magistrate
   Complaint referrals from the State Courts pursuant to section 15 of
   the CMCs Act. CMCs have also worked with other frontline agencies
   such as family service centres, community centres and the police to
   set up satellite mediation venues at suitable locations near to where
   Singaporeans live and work.

   **Other Mediation and Counselling Centres**

   Mediation work for family and community-related issues is also
   undertaken by non-profit organisations in Singapore. For example, the
   Eagles Mediation and Counselling Centre (EMCC) conducts community
   mediation and counseling programmes for individuals, families, youths
   and organisations.

**Mediation in Family and Divorce Matters, Ministry of Community
Development, Youth and Sports (MCYS)**

Mediation is also used to resolve disputes in the Tribunal of
Maintenance of Parents (TMP) and the Syariah Court under MCYS.

The **TMP** provides a legal avenue for elderly parents to apply for a
maintenance order against their children. When a case is brought to the
TMP, the Tribunal first refers parties to a conciliation officer for
mediation, to try to help them arrive at a settlement.

In the **Syariah Court**, mediation is also used to help married
couples of the Muslim faith in filing for divorce issues such as the
custody of children, division of matrimonial property and other divorce
and ancillary issues. This helps the couple to maintain ties and
continue to communicate after the divorce for the sake of their
children.

THE TRAFFIC COURT
=================

The Traffic Court hears and tries traffic offences. It deals with all
fresh traffic arrest cases, Traffic Police summonses/notices where there
are no offers of composition as well as Land Transport Authority
summonses/notices where there are no offers of composition.

It operates as a mentions court which deals with a wide variety of
applications including applications for bail, remand and adjournments
and is involved in the management of traffic cases. It is also the trial
court for traffic cases.

Traffic offences *without* any offer of composition
---------------------------------------------------

If there is no offer of composition, you are required to attend the
Traffic Court on the date and time stipulated. Once you have been dealt
with by the Traffic Court, you will be given either a fine ticket (blue
in colour) or a Fine Advice Chit by the Court Officer. You can make the
payment at the Finance Section which is located at Level one of the
State Courts, Havelock Square Complex.

Minor traffic offences *with* an offer of composition
-----------------------------------------------------

A traffic offence is considered minor if there is an offer of
composition stated on the traffic ticket or notice. There is an offer of
composition if the ticket or notice states a sum of money which you can
pay to settle the ticket or notice without going to court.

**AXS Stations:** Anyone who receives a traffic ticket or notice from
the Traffic Police Department, Land Transport Authority, Housing and
Development Board or Urban Redevelopment Authority for a minor traffic
offence may use the AXS Station to settle the fine.

If the offer of composition has expired, users can use the Automated
Traffic Offence Management System (ATOMS) to settle their tickets or
notices by pleading guilty to the traffic offence stated in their ticket
or notice and pay a court fine. With ATOMS, users can settle their
traffic tickets at their convenience and there is no need to go to
court.

ATOMS is run on the AXS Stations which are located island-wide. You can
call the AXS Hotline at `6560 2727 <tel:+6565602727>` or visit their website at
http://www.axs.com.sg to find the AXS Station nearest to you.

Please note that the operating hours for the AXS Hotline are:

8.00 am to 10.00 pm daily

(including Sundays and public holidays)


Commonly Asked Questions on the Traffic Court
-------------------------------------------------

**Can I claim legal aid for a traffic offence?**

Yes, it is possible but not guaranteed, as there are rules on
eligibility for free legal aid, depending on the individual lawyer/ law
firm or other organization you approach in regards to your case.

**Should I hire a lawyer, or can I represent myself in Court?**

This depends on whether your traffic offence is a minor or serious one.

Your traffic ticket/notice will indicate whether your traffic offence is
serious or minor. If the ticket specifies an “offer of composition”,
your offence is considered minor. You can pay a “composition” to settle
the ticket/notice without going to court (thus, you do not have to hire
counsel), provided you pay on time.

If there is no offer of composition, your offence is considered serious.
You must attend court on the appointed date. If you plead guilty, the
court will impose a sentence. If you claim trial, a date will be set for
the case to be heard. [318]_

**On what grounds can my licence be suspended/revoked?**

Singapore's demerit points system named the Driver Improvement Points
System (DIPS) was introduced on 1 March 1983. DIPS is designed to
identify and rehabilitate errant drivers through a system of rewards and
punishments. Errant motorists are thus encouraged to improve their
driving behaviours on the roads with incentives to expunge their demerit
points and previous suspension record as well as remission of suspension
period.

For new motorists who are *under one year of probation* from the date of
grant on their dirving licence, the driving licence can be revoked and
become invalid when 13 or more demerit points are accumulated. The
licence holder will have to retake all necessary tests to obtain a
licence again.

For *non-probation motorists*, where they have no previous suspension
record with Traffic Police, and they have accumulated 24 or more demerit
points within 24 consecuive months, their driving licence will become
liable for the 1\ :sup:`st` suspension of 12 weeks. If a motorists has a
previous suspension record with Traffice Police, and they have
accumulated 12 or more demerit points within 12 months, their driving
lience will become liable for the subsequent suspension. For subsequent
suspensions after the 1\ :sup:`st` suspension, the suspension periods
are:

-  2\ :sup:`nd` suspension: 24 weeks

-  3\ :sup:`rd` suspension: 1 year

-  4\ :sup:`th` suspension: 2 years

-  5\ :sup:`th` suspension (onwards): 3 years

Where the suspension period lasts a year or longer (ie. 3\ :sup:`rd`
suspension and onwards), the driving licence will be revoked and become
invalid. The licence holder will have to retake all the necessary
driving tests (theory and practical) to obtain a licence to drive/ride
again.

Motorists liable for 1\ :sup:`st` and 2\ :sup:`nd` suspension will offer
a retraining course to correct their driving beaviours. If they take and
pass the retraining course, their suspension period will be given a
remission. For 1st suspension, the suspension period will be reduced
from 12 weeks to 4 weeks. If none of their traffic offences leading to
their 1st suspension was involved in traffic accident, their suspension
period will be further reduced to 1 week; and for 2nd suspension, it
will be reduced from 24 weeks to 12 weeks.

There is no offer of retraining course and remission for 3rd and
subsequent suspensions.

**What are the offences listed under DIPS?**

Under the DIPS, demerit points are given from a list of scheduled
offences under the Road Traffic (DIPS) Rules.

** **

**What do I do if issued with a warrant of arrest?**

If you have settled all your traffic summonses, and would like to find
out why there is a warrant of arrest issued against you, you can send an
email to: SPF\_TP\_Summons\_Processing@spf.gov.sg or call (65) 6 547
0000 to check.

*Warrants are typically issued when a person fails to appear in court or
is being sought on criminal charges.* It is best to consult a criminal
lawyer for advice on how to possibly avoid being locked up, and not less
importantly, to prepare for your defense.

The Warrant will be handed over to the Warrant Enforcement Unit (a
division of the Singapore Police Force) or the respective enforcement
agencies for them to execute. The police will either arrest you or you
may be asked to surrender yourself at the Warrant Enforcement Unit for
the warrant to be executed.

As a condition of the Warrant of Arrest, bail may or may not be offered
upon arrest. If no bail is offered, you will be brought to Court within
48 hours of your arrest; if bail is offered, you will be asked to
furnish the bail sum before you may be released to attend Court on a
specified date. If you are unable to find a bailor, you will be brought
to Court within 48 hours of your arrest. In certain cases, you may be
disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence pending your
arrest.

**How can I get a charge withdrawn?**

If you in fact committed the offence charged against you, there is no
way that the charge can be withdrawn completely. However, if you feel
that you did not commit the offence, or that the summons was not
justifiable, you may make an appeal by writing to the Traffic Police or
LTA. [320]_

**Traffic Police appeals**

Write to: Chief Investigation Officer Violation Reports Investigation
Branch, Traffic Police Department, 10 Ubi Avenue 3, Singapore 408865 

Email:
`*SPF\_TP\_Summons\_Processing@spf.gov.sg* <mailto:SPF_TP_Summons_Processing@spf.gov.sg>`__

**LTA appeals**

`*https://vrl.lta.gov.sg/lta/vrl/action/pubfunc?ID=AddAppeal* <https://vrl.lta.gov.sg/lta/vrl/action/pubfunc?ID=AddAppeal>`__

**Can the number of charges against me be reduced?**

If you think you have a good reason for committing the offence, you can
try to mitigate the offence. Use an `*AXS
station* <http://www.axs.com.sg/axsStation_locations.php>`__ and answer
“Yes” when asked if you want to mitigate the offence. You will be
required to attend a court hearing and explain your reasons to the
judge. [321]_

Commonly Asked Questions on Handphone Driving [322]_

For the offence of handphone driving to stand, **ALL** the following 3
conditions must be fulfilled:

    (1) The vehicle is in motion

    (2) The driver is holding on to the handphone with one hand; while
    his other hand is holding the steering wheel

    (3) The driver is communicating with any person with that handphone

**Note:** If the driver is not holding on to the steering wheel at all,
he can be charged for reckless or dangerous driving. Upon conviction,
first-time offenders can be fined up to S$3000/-, or jailed for a term
up to 12 months, or both. Repeat offenders are liable for a maximum fine
of S$5000/-, or to imprisonment for a term up to 2 years, or both. In
addition, they may also be disqualified from holding or obtaining a
driving licence. This includes making phone calls, paging someone,
receiving a call by pressing the keypad, and reading, writing or sending
an SMS.

**Purpose of the rules:** The purpose of setting the three conditions is
to ensure that drivers who have no intention to commit handphone driving
will not be caught by ambiguous rules. For example, a driver who simply
holds a mobile phone but is not using it to communicate while driving
will not have committed the offence. However, if by doing so, the driver
loses attention on the roads and fails to maintain proper control of his
vehicle, he will still have committed an offence of driving without due
care or reasonable consideration.

Similarly, the spirit of the law is such that the driver who uses his
handphone is only a menace to other road users if his vehicle is moving.
Hence, drivers who use their handphones while their vehicles are
stationary will not be caught.

In short, Traffic Police do not take action against motorists for
handphone driving simply because there is a handphone on the passenger
seat or beside the driver. Traffic Police will only take action when our
observations show that all the three conditions for the offence of
handphone driving are concurrently present.

All handphone driving offenders will be prosecuted in court, regardless
of whether the motorist is a first-timer or repeat offender. A
first-timer convicted of phone and drive offence shall be liable to 12
demerit points and a maximum fine of up to $1000/- or to imprisonment
for a term not exceeding 6 months or both. He/She may also be
disqualified from driving. The offender's handphone and SIM card will be
seized to facilitate investigation. These may be forfeited by the court
upon conviction.

**Common Scenarios:**

**Scenario A (Paging for someone):** Page for someone, with or without
earpiece, using one hand to hold on to the mobile phone while driving.

**Scenario B (SMS/MMS message):** Writing, Sending, and Reading SMS/MMS
messages from someone, with or without earpiece, using one hand to hold
on to the mobile phone while driving.

**Scenario C (Making a Call):** Making a call, with or without earpiece,
by pressing the keypads and was holding handphone in one hand while
driving.

**Scenario D (Receiving a Call):** Receiving a call, with or without
earpiece, by pressing the keypads and was holding handphone in one hand
while driving.
