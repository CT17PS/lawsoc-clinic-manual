WILLS, INTESTACY, PROBATE & ADMINISTRATION [241]_
=================================================

Making a Will
-------------

**What is a Will?**

A Will is a legal document by which a person writing the Will ("the
Testator") can, amongst other things -

1. Dictate how his/her assets shall be administered and distributed
   after his/her death. The recipients of these assets are known as
   "beneficiaries";

2. Appoint a person ("the Executor") to carry out such administration
   and distribution upon the Testator’s death; and

3. Appoint guardians for his/her children who may still be under the age
   of 21 at the Testator’s death.

**How is a Will Created?**

There are certain basic requirements for a valid will -

1. The Testator must be older than 21 years old;

2. The Testator must have the requisite mental capacity to make the
   will;

3. The will must be made in writing, and must be signed by the Testator
   in the presence of two (2) witnesses; and

4. The witnesses to the execution of the will can be a Testator's
   lawyer, friend or relative (excluding spouse) as long as the witness
   is not a beneficiary under the will.

A maximum of four (4) people can be appointed as Executor/Trustee under
a will, although the more Executor/Trustees are appointed, the harder it
is for all of them to make a decision.

**Important note:** Under section 115(1) of the Administration of Muslim
Law Act, the beneficiaries must apply to the President of the Syariah
Court for an Inheritance Certificate to establish the share of each
beneficiary. Muslims can only dispose off or give away 1/3 of their
estate to persons who are not already entitled under the Inheritance
Certificate mentioned above.

**What assets you can include in a Will?**

Only assets that are under your sole name can be passed on under a will,
although this includes any tenancies-in-common, which are divisible and
can be bequeathed.

Assets which cannot be included in a will are -

1. Any immovable properties that are held in joint tenancy;

2. Monies in Central Provident Fund;

3. Insurance policies in which you have nominated beneficiaries.

**Money in your Central Provident Fund (CPF)**

Under the laws of Singapore, the savings in your CPF Ordinary, Special,
Medisave and Retirement Account as well as any discounted SingTel Shares
cannot be distributed under your Will. Instead you will have to make a
nomination under the CPF Act.

Your nominee will then be entitled to the funds in your CPF account. If
you have not made a nomination, your funds will be distributed under the
law in accordance with the Intestate Succession.

If you get married after making a nomination, your nomination made
before marriage is automatically cancelled, unless you say that it was
made in contemplation of marriage. Therefore, you ought to make a new
nomination after marrying.

**Changing your Will**

Never attempt to change your Will by crossing parts out or adding words
in or by attaching anything to it. If you do so your Will may become
ineffective or invalid. If you wish to change your Will, either make a
fresh Will or prepare a Supplemental Will (“a Codicil”).

**Reviewing your Will**

If you marry or remarry, your Will is revoked unless the Will was made
in contemplation of your marriage.

You should also review your Will if any of the following happens:

a. If you change your name or anyone mentioned in the Will changes his
   name.

b. If an executor or trustee dies or becomes incapable of carrying out
   his duties owing to ill-health.

c. If a beneficiary dies (this is called a “Lapse”).

d. If you subsequently sell or part with any property mentioned in the
   Will.

e. If there is any significant change in circumstances, for example,
   when you acquire property or assets which have not been mentioned in
   your Will.

It is advisable to review your Will regularly.

**Making known your Will**

Although a Will is a private document, it is important that your family
and especially your executors know that you have a Will and where you
have kept it. You should submit an online deposit form to the Wills
Registry which is maintained by the Public Trustee. The Registry acts as
a central information centre for all wills that are drawn up, of which
notice has been given to the Public Trustee. The Wills Registry,
however, only keeps a record that you have done a Will and does not
actually keep a copy of the Will itself. You do not have to register the
Will in order to validate it.

This form can be downloaded from their website at
https://www.mlaw.gov.sg/content/pto/en.html.

Apart from registering your Will with the Wills Registry, you may wish
to deposit the original Will with your lawyer for safekeeping. You
should then give your executors your lawyer’s name and address.

**Administering your estate**

Your Will takes effect upon your death. Your executors would have to
apply to Court for a Grant of Probate. The Court will only issue the
Grant after it is satisfied that all procedural requirements are met.
Estate Duty clearance will be required before a Grant is obtained for
deaths that took place before 15 February 2008.

Once the Grant of Probate is issued, the original Will is retained by
the Court. The executors will be given a copy of the Will together with
the Grant. All your property and assets will then pass to your
executors, who will have the responsibility of administering and
distributing the estate according to the instructions in your Will.

If You Do Not Make A Will
-------------------------

If you pass away without making a Will, your assets will be distributed
according to the rules of intestacy as laid down in the Intestate
Succession Act. Your lawyer can advise you about these rules and how
they apply to you. If you die without making a Will, your estate may be
distributed to persons to whom you do not intend to give anything.

Also, if you pass away without making a Will, you cannot choose the
people who will look after your estate. Administrators, rather than
executors, will look after your estate, although they have the same
responsibilities. Administrators have to apply to Court for "Letters of
Administration" instead of the Grant of Probate and the procedure is
generally more complicated. For example, the administrators will have to
provide two guarantors unless they get approval from the Court.

Therefore, if you want to provide for your family members, friends or a
charity after your death, you should consider making a Will as it will
be easier and more convenient.

Costs
-----

If you are concerned about the cost of making a Will, discuss this with
your lawyer. You can ask your lawyer for an estimate of the costs
involved before appointing him.

Syariah Law
-----------

Some of the points mentioned above do not apply to Muslims. Under
section 115(1) of the Administration of Muslim Law Act, the
beneficiaries must apply to the President of the Syariah Court for an
Inheritance Certificate to establish the share of each beneficiary.
Muslims can only dispose off or give away 1/3 of their estate to persons
who are not already entitled under the Inheritance Certificate mentioned
above.

Commonly Asked Questions on Wills
---------------------------------

**Do I need a lawyer?**

If you are 21 years and of sound mind, you may make your own Will and
change it at any time during your life without consulting a lawyer. (s4
of the Wills Act) But the risk is that your home-made Will may be
ineffective or invalid, causing your beneficiaries to suffer unnecessary
expense. It is therefore in your interest to consult a lawyer who can
advise you and draft your Will for you according to law.

However, if you are a soldier in active military service, or a mariner
or a seaman at sea, you may make a Will even though you are under 21
years (s5 of the Wills Act).

**What will make a Will ineffective or invalid?**

Your Will is invalid if it does not conform to the rules of formal
validity under the Wills Act:

-  A Will must be committed to writing (verbal declaration of the
   Testator’s intentions does not constitute a valid Will).

-  The testator must be at least 21 of age.

-  The testator must sign the Will at the foot of the Will. If the
   testator is unable to do so, he may direct another person to sign it
   in his presence.

-  A Will must be witnessed by two witnesses, and they must also sign
   the Will in the presence of the testator.

-  The two witnesses cannot be beneficiaries of the Will, or spouses of
   the beneficiaries.

If you change your Will by crossing parts out or adding words in or by
attaching anything to it and not by making a fresh Will or prepare a
Supplemental Will (codicil), your Will may become ineffective or invalid
(s15 of the Wills Act).

If you marry or remarry, your Will is revoked unless the Will was made
in contemplation of your marriage (s13 of the Wills Act).

**What if I cannot afford a lawyer?**

Normally, it costs around a few hundred Singapore dollars to engage a
lawyer to draft a Will. If it is not affordable for you, you may
consider obtaining free legal advice by visiting a Community Legal
Clinic, provided by the Pro Bono Service Office to clarify any queries
you may have on drafting a Will. For more information, you may refer to
the website of the Pro Bono Service Office [242]_. You may also find a
list of other legal clinics there.

If you require further services, you may consider applying to the Legal
Aid Bureau, which can assist in appointing a lawyer for you if you meet
their entry requirements. Ad Hoc Pro Bono Services by the Pro Bono
Service Office can also assist in putting you in touch with a lawyer who
is willing to take up the case on a pro bono basis.

**What will happen to assets I do not mention in my Will?**

Where you pass away leaving behind a Will which does not deal with all
of your estate, those assets not disposed of in your Will will be
distributed in accordance with the rules under the Intestate Succession
Act. This situation is usually described as “partial intestacy”. For the
Intestate Succession Act, you may refer to the explanation “If You Do
Not Make A Will” above.

It is good to have an Inventory List of your Assets and Liabilities
attached to your Last Will in order to list down all the assets you own.
This will help your executor in the event of your death. You should also
update your Inventory List from time to time to reflect changes to your
asset list. Further, to avoid the status of “partial intestacy”, it is
crucial to include a “residuary clause” in your Will.

**What if someone doesn’t agree with my choice of beneficiaries?**

You have a right to choose beneficiaries solely at your discretion in
your Will and can choose your family members, your friends or even an
organization as beneficiaries in your Will.

However, this right of choice of beneficiaries is subject to the
provisions of the Inheritance (Family Provision) Act where your
dependants can apply to Court for a reasonable provision of maintenance
from your estate even though they are not beneficiaries under your Will.
The Court has the power to order that your estate make payment to these
dependents either as a lump sum or on such terms that the Court deems
fit. Dependants which may be entitled to make such application are (s3
of the Inheritance Act):

-  A spouse.

-  An unmarried daughter

-  A son who has not attained his age of 21 years.

-  A son or a daughter who is in capable of maintaining himself or
       herself, by reason of some mental or physical disability.

**Is a hand-written will valid?**

Yes, you can prepare a hand-written Will by hand since the Will Act does
not question the form of writing of a Will. A hand-written Will may be
valid as long as it is properly executed in accordance with the Wills
Act.

But, you should be aware that you still need to sign your Will in the
presence of witnesses and it is not possible to make a valid Will alone.

**Is a Will drafted overseas valid in Singapore?**

Yes, even if a Will is drafted and executed overseas, it can be a valid
Will. However, the Will has to be executed according to:

-  The territory of execution of the Will.

-  The territory of domicile of the testator when the Will was executed
   or at the time of his death.

-  The territory of habitual residence of the testator when the Will was
   executed or at the time of his death: or

-  The territory of which the testator was a national when the Will was
   executed or at the time of his death.

**Can I draft a will on someone else’s behalf?**

Yes. You can assist to draft a Will on another person’s behalf. However,
the person making the Will will have to be the person that signs at the
foot of the Will as the testator.

**How does someone who “lacks capacity” (eg. mental illness, etc) draft
a will? **

A person who lacks mental capacity will not be able to make a Will. The
Testator has to be of sound mind, and mentally capable of understanding
what he/she is doing and the consequences of that action, when making a
Will.

Hence, before a Will is executed, if there may be a dispute as to the
mental capacity of a testator, a medical report should be obtained to
substantiate that a person is of such sound mind as to be able to make a
Will. Sometimes, allegations of undue influence can also be asserted by
certain parties, on the Testator. Undue influence can refer to the
unconscientious use of one’s power over another, such as coercion,
threats, harassments or persistent persuasion.

However, people who are illiterate can still make a Will. If a Testator
cannot read or write, he can ask someone else to write down his
intention. If a testator cannot sign his name, he can affix his
thumbprint on the document. What matters is that the testator has the
mental capacity and understands that he is making a Will, and the
consequences of doing so.

**What happens to my debt? Who will inherit my mortgage, etc?**

An administrator or an executor has to make payment of any debts and
expenses of the deceased prior to the distribution of his estate.

| If there aren’t enough assets to cover the debts, the estate is said
  to be insolvent. For insolvent estate, the order of priority in the
  repayment of debts have to be accordance with the \ *First
  Schedule* of the Probate and Administration Act, and then rules under
  the \ *Bankruptcy Act* will follow. If there aren’t enough funds left
  over to pay all the creditors in one group, the amount left will be
  prorated to creditors in the group. The beneficiaries will also get
  nothing, even if a will leaves them specific property or specified
  sums of money. Beneficiaries can only receive assets in probate if
  there are enough assets left over after all legitimate debts have been
  paid.
| On the other hand, in the case of a solvent estate, creditors will get
  paid in the order found in the Second Schedule of the Probate and
  Administration Act.

A creditor can also apply for the Letters of Administration as a
creditor where spouses or next of kin of the deceased do not apply.

**What about my CPF?**

As stated above, distribution of assets of the deceased is generally
handled by an administrator or an executor.

However, the Central Provident Fund (CPF) is different. CPF is a
comprehensive social security savings plan administered by the Singapore
government.Under the CPF Act, the savings in your CPF Ordinary, Special,
Medisave and Retirement Account as well as any discounted SingTel Shares
cannot be distributed under your Will. If a CPF member makes a
nomination under this Act, the CPF contributions made and death benefits
payable under the insurance scheme administered by the CPF Board will be
distributed to the nominees specified under the nomination without the
need for a Grant of Probate to be extracted for the member’s estate.

For more information about assets handled outside the power of an
Administrator or Executor, see “Administration of Small Estates by the
Public Trustee”.

**Do I have to disclose my criminal record or declare previous
convictions when drafting a Will?**

No. A Will is a private document wherein you dictate matters such as the
disposal of assets, and the guardianship of infant children. Thus, past
criminal record and previous convictions do not have to be disclosed
with making a Will.

**What if the deceased gives something away which they were not entitled
too in the first place (eg. property in someone else’s name, etc)?**

| The testator can only dispose of assets under his name. Thus, if a
  Testator gives something which does not belong to him/her in a Will,
  such part of a Will will not have effect.
| Immovable property that is owned by you with another person in joint
  tenancy is subject to the general rule of survivorship, wherein a
  joint owner who survives is entitled to the whole ownership of the
  joint asset once another joint owner passes away.

| However, this rule does not apply if your immovable properties is held
  in a “Tenancy-in-common”, where each of the joint owners owns an
  identifiable share of the immovable property and can deal with his
  share of the immovable property in his Will.
| The manner of holding and the specific share of each owner is stated
  on the documents conferring the title of immovable property on the
  owners, like the Certificate of Title.

Administration of Small Estates by The Public Trustee [243]_
-------------------------------------------------------------

Overview Of Services Provided By The Public Trustee
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Administration of Estates of Deceased Persons **

The Public Trustee administers small estates of deceased persons where
the value of the estate does not exceed $50,000.00.

assets in the estate and distributes these to the beneficiaries. The
Public Trustee ascertains the beneficiaries according to the Intestate
Succession Act (Cap. 146) for non-Muslims and Administration of Muslim
Law Act (Cap. 3) for Muslims.

If the beneficiary is a minor, the Public Trustee will hold his share in
trust until he attains 21 years old. In the meantime, the minor
beneficiary’s guardian can apply to the Public Trustee for the child’s
monthly maintenance.

The assets that are administered by the Public Trustee include:

-  Deceased’s monies in banks or other financial institutions in
   Singapore.

-  Deceased’s shares which are listed on SGX.

-  Deceased’s vehicle, except taxis.

-  Deceased’s undrawn salary.

-  Compensation monies due to the deceased.

**Who Can Apply To the Public Trustee? **

Any person over 21 years old can apply. Friends or relatives can also
apply on behalf of beneficiaries.

**Statutory Fees Charged **

The statutory fees payable to the Public Trustee are as follows:

Where the Public Trustee is unable to administer the estate, you may
have to apply to the Courts for Letters of Administration (i.e. appoint
administrators) to deal with the deceased’s estate. If you qualify for
legal aid, you may apply to the Legal Aid Bureau at The URA Centre, East
Wing, 45 Maxwell Road, #07-11, Singapore 069118 to assist you to apply

About the Wills Registry [244]_
-------------------------------

**What is the Wills Registry? **

The Public Trustee maintains a confidential Wills Registry where
testators and their solicitors can deposit information on Wills. No
actual wills are deposited at the Wills Registry. All Wills must be kept
by the testator or his/her representative.

The will information will be kept in the system for 120 years from the
date of birth of the person making the will.

**What are the benefits of the Wills Registry? **

In the administration of a deceased’s estate, the administrator or
executor has to first determine whether the deceased left behind a Will.
Often, the next-of-kin or beneficiaries may also believe that the
deceased may have done so but do not have a copy of the Will or
information as to which solicitor drew up the Will.

The information available from the Wills Registry will be useful to the
following persons:

-  The person who made the Will (also known as the testator) and/or
       his/her solicitors if the testator wishes to make a subsequent
       Will.

-  The solicitors acting for the estate of the deceased testator to
       assist them in the administration of the deceased testator’s
       estate, **or **

-  The next-of-kin or beneficiaries of a deceased.

**What kind of information can be deposited at the Wills Registry? **

The Public Trustee welcomes testators and their solicitors to deposit
information on Wills, including Wills that have been previously drawn
up, with the Wills Registry by completing this form and providing the
following information:

-  Particulars of the Testator.

-  Date of Will and Codicil (i.e. a supplement modifying a Will).

-  Particulars of the Solicitor/Person who has drawn up the Will.

Who Can Apply For Probate Or Letters Of Administration?

**Probate**

You can apply for probate if you are the executor(s) named in the Will
of the deceased person.

**Letters Of Administration**

In the case of the Letters of Administration, you and any of your family
members are entitled to apply to be appointed administrator(s). However,
the law gives priority to certain members of the family over others,
depending on the marital status of the deceased and his family
composition. For example, if the deceased person was single, his
surviving parents will have priority over his brothers and sisters to be
the administrators; if the deceased person was married with children,
his spouse will have priority over the children to be his administrator.

Please note that the law requires at least 2 administrators to be
appointed where there is/are one or more minor beneficiaries. A minor
beneficiary is any person below 21 years of age who has a share in the
estate. This is to protect the minor beneficiary's interest in the
estate.

Letters of Administration (as the case may be), can I renounce my right
to apply?**

having priority in law to apply for a Grant of Letters of Administration
and you are unwilling or unable to apply for a Grant of Probate or a

Administration Bond to extract the grant. The Administration Bond has to
be signed by you and your sureties, if any.

Where any beneficiary is under 21 years of age, or the value of the
estate exceeds S$250,000 you are required to furnish 2 sureties to the
Administration Bond. This is to ensure that you administer the estate
properly. The sureties must have assets worth the total value of the
deceased's estate.

After the Registrar approves the particulars of the sureties, they have
to affirm or swear an affidavit certifying their worth. If you cannot
get any person to stand as surety, you may apply to the Court to
dispense with the sureties. You will have to affirm or swear an
affidavit setting out the reasons for your application. You will also
have to obtain the consent of all adult beneficiaries and creditors to
the dispensation of sureties. The Court has the discretion to dispense
with one or both sureties.

**How do I extract the grant? **

After the estate duty matters have been settled, you may apply to
extract the grant. This is done by way of a Request to extract Grant of
Probate or Letters of Administration [whichever is applicable] and
filing of the Administration Bond (if it is a case of Letters of
Administration being extracted). before filling the request, you should
conduct a search to ensure that there are no caveats in force against
the estate.

**Must I engage a lawyer? **

You may wish to engage a lawyer if the estate of the deceased is complex
or if you are unfamiliar with the legal procedures such as preparation
and filing of numerous documents, and attending Court.

Commonly Asked Questions On Probate / Letter Of Administration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Executors/Administrators**

**What are my obligations as an executor? How long can I take?**

The executor may be required to perform the following, depending on the
contents of the will:

1. Apply for probate.

2. Make the arrangements for the funeral of the deceased.

3. Determine the total assets and liabilities of the deceased.

4. Resolve the outstanding income tax liability of the deceased,
   according to section 58 of the `Income Tax
   Act <http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/aol/search/display/view.w3p;page=0;query=DocId%3A45fc380e-12d4-4935-b138-c42dc45d377c%20Depth%3A0;rec=0;resUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fstatutes.agc.gov.sg%2Faol%2Fbrowse%2FtitleResults.w3p%3Bletter%3DI%3Btype%3DactsAll;whole=yes>`__.

5. Pursue any debts owed to the deceased.

6. Resolve any debts or liabilities of the deceased. In the case of an
   insolvent estate, the order of priority in the repayment of debts can
   be found in the \ `Bankruptcy
   Act <http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/aol/search/display/view.w3p;page=0;query=DocId%3Ac342424a-8867-494a-bbab-91b696d12bdc%20Depth%3A0;rec=0;resUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fstatutes.agc.gov.sg%2Faol%2Fbrowse%2FtitleResults.w3p%3Bletter%3DB%3Btype%3DactsAll;whole=yes>`__,

   Schedule <http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/aol/search/display/view.w3p;ident=cfe43bcd-816c-47fb-8fa7-11dde4d3c225;page=0;query=DocId%3Af157ad50-12b0-43d2-9734-34a734c957c8%20Depth%3A0;rec=0;resUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fstatutes.agc.gov.sg%2Faol%2Fbrowse%2FtitleResults.w3p%3Bletter%3DP%3BpNum%3D1%3Btype%3DactsAll>`__ of
   the Probate and Administration Act.

7. Distribute the assets to the beneficiaries or their respective
   guardians, in accordance to the will.

8. Perform your duties in accordance with the Law.

The length of time it would take to carry out the duties of an executor
will depend on various factors. Probate is a complex process, which can
involve many individuals, organizations and government departments.
Insurance companies, banks and Revenue and Customs Authorities are just
some of those that need to be contacted. On average, probate takes
between six to nine months to complete and can take up to eighty working
hours. It is not an unusual occurrence for it to stretch out for as long
as a year, and perhaps even longer if things are not straightforward.

**Contested will:** If the Will is contested, this will certainly
further stretch out the settlement process. Claims regarding the
validity of the will itself can be brought many years after the date of
death. If a claim is made, the estate should not be distributed until
after the claim has been dealt with. The amount of time that Probate
will take will depend on the size and complexity of their estate. A
testator who owned shares, several bank accounts, and more than one
property in different, far off locations would leave a complex
collection of assets for their executor to take stock of. This will be
complicated further if the testator named a number of different
beneficiaries in their Will. If the testator had any creditors, the
executor of the Will needs to settle these, using the assets of the
deceased. This must be done before any money or assets have are to any
beneficiaries, and thus the duties of the executor will not end until
such is achieved.

**How do I compile a list of all the deceased’s assets?**

It is important to identify the assets of the deceased. When doing this,
you should be aware that assets can contain not only real estate and
stock investments, but also any property of value. If there is a Will of
the deceased, you can refer to the assets listed up in the Will. However
you should be careful that the deceased may own more assets than what is
stated in the Will. It may be also give a clue by looking for any unpaid
amounts due the deceased including interest, dividends, and other income
(e.g., in bank statements).

**How do I get a certified true copy of someone’s death certificates?**

**
**\ Death certificates are issued by the ICA office. Application for
issuance of the certificates can be made online or in person. Applicants
are required to show his/her identity.

For details of the application, please refer to the explanation of
“Apply for Death Extracts” at the website of ICA [249]_.

**What if the executor can’t be found?**

If the Executor cannot be found the Court will appoint the fittest
person to administer the deceased's estate according to the Will. The
Court could decide to appoint one or more persons, depending on how the
relevant orders pursuant to the Will and the Letters of Administration
require to do so. The order in considering the persons to be appointed
by Court is as follows:

    (a) A universal or residuary legatee.

    (*b*) A legal personal representative of a deceased universal or
    residuary legatee.

    (*c*) Such person or persons, being beneficiaries under the will, as
    would have been entitled to a grant of letters of administration if
    the deceased had died intestate.

    (*d*) A legatee having a beneficial interest.

    (*e*) A creditor of the deceased.

**Can an administrator/executor distribute assets to themselves?**

The executor/administrator can distribute the assets to himself if he is
a beneficiary of the deceased's estate. Otherwise it would be a breach
of his duties to do so and the beneficiaries can take action against the
executor/administrator.

It is important to note that Executors have a lot of work. There are
professional executors that charge for their services and there are
non-professional Executors who will only claim reimbursement of their
expenses. Thus part of the assets will be used to pay for the fees
charged by the professional executor, or the reimbursement of the costs
of the non-professional executor.

**Can anyone apply to be an executor/administrator of an estate? Can I
be the executor/administrator of my friend’s estate?**

To become an executor/administrator of someone´s estate, you either have
to be appointed by the Will or by the Court following the rules of
priority to grant such status, as per Section13 of the Probate and
Administration Act. Thus only those persons appointed in the Will or
those who pursuant to Section13 of the Probate and Administration Act
have a right to make such an application to Court.

**In relation to Letters of Administration, what is meant by
administering someone’s estate “in accordance with the law”? What kind
of process/procedure do I have to follow?**

The administration of someone´s estate “in accordance with the law”
refers both to the way the estate should be administered pursuant to the
directions and orders of the person in the will or the rule of
intestacy, as regulated in Intestate Succession Act.

It also refers to the way the Executor has to perform his role (whether
testate or intestate succession), pursuant to the regulations contained
in the Probate and Administration Act.

Accordingly the Executor shall abide to all the applicable and relevant
regulations to his role depending on the circumstances and should also
fully comply with all enforceable regulations contained in the Letters
of Administration.

**Will a Grant of Letters of Administration or a Grant of Probate allow
me to distribute property located overseas?**

No. You will either have to apply for a fresh Grant of Letters of
Administration or a fresh Grant of Probate in that foreign country or
apply for a resealing of the Grant of Letters of Administration or a
resealing of a Grant of Probate which you had already obtained from the
Singapore Courts.

**Can I become the administrator of a non-Singaporean’s Will in another
jurisdiction?**

This would depend on the rules of Probates and Administrator of the
other jurisdiction. For these purposes, the administrator would have to
provide that the power granted to him is enough to manage the estate of
the deceased. Thus it would depend on the jurisdiction and the relevant
laws applicable thereof.

**As a minor, can I change the executor of my will/administrator of my
estate?**

Yes. Executors of Wills that involve minors can be removed because of
the same reasons and other executors (please refer to the section
“removing/replacing administrators/executors”). The minor acts through
his guardian and thus it is the guardian that has file the request
before the Court. The duty to act in the beneficiaries’ best interests
will be more rigorously assessed by the Court when it comes to minors
who have a right to special protection.

**Can an executor of a will be under 21 years old at the time the will
is made?**

Yes, as long as the executor is above the age of 21 at the time of death
of the testator.

**Do multiple executors have to execute the will together? Or do other
beneficiaries have to submit a letter of renunciation first?**

When multiple executors are appointed, they have to act in unison.
Accordingly, they must take all decisions unanimously and all of them
must execute all the documents required to be signed during the
administration of the estate of the deceased and the allocation of the
assets pursuant to the will or the rules of intestacy. Thus, engaging
multiple executors is likely to delay rather than facilitate the
execution process.

**BENEFICIARIES**

**How will I know if I am a beneficiary of a will?**

The executor has the duty to notify all the beneficiaries that they hold
such rights under the will or pursuant to the rules of intestacy. It is
important to note that Singapore has a Wills Registry. The Wills
Registry keeps the following information:

-  Details of the person making the will i.e. testator.

-  Date of the will.

-  Details of the person who drew up the will.

-  Details of where the will is held.

The Wills Registry will not keep a copy nor original version of the
Will.

**Does a beneficiary have to be Singaporean?**

A beneficiary does not have to be Singaporean. However, it is advisable
to duly identify the non-Singaporean either with their passport or local
ID number. The non-Singaporean may be an international charity or a
Permanent Resident in Singapore. It is also important to analyse whether
there will be any restrictions and regulations that will affect the
transfer of certain types of properties such as HDBs in Singapore to
such beneficiaries.

**What are my rights as a beneficiary of a will?**

These rights are:

-  To know if a Will exists.

-  To know the contents of the Will and request a copy of such text.

-  To be informed by the executor/administrator of the current status of
       his task, and to be informed on how the estate is being managed
       towards distribution of the assets.

-  To receive the assets as per stated in the Will or according to the
       intestacy rules contained in the Intestate Succession Act.

-  To request the removal of the Administrator/Executor.

-  To make an application for a Grant of Probate or a Grant of Letters
       of Administration from a Court subject to the provisions of
       Section 13 of the Probate and Administration Act.

**What are my rights as a spouse/child of the deceased? What if we were
not on good terms?**

The starting question is whether there was a will or not. If there was a
Will, the provisions therein will be respected. Nevertheless it is
important to note that there are exceptions as provided in the Wills Act
regarding a minimum welfare that is guaranteed for spouses and children.

As for intestate succession, Section 7 of the Intestate Succession Act
provides that the child and the spouse will be entitled to the
deceased's estate regardless of the quality of their relationship with
the deceased.

**Do ex-spouses have any claim to a deceased’s estate? What about if
there are ongoing divorce proceedings?**

Only surviving current Spouses have a right to claim part of the
Deceased´s estate. However, it is important to note that the ex-Spouse
could be appointed as a Guardian of the surviving children of the
deceased, and in such cases the ex-Spouse can claim part of the estate
for the welfare and upbringing of the children.

Where there is an ongoing divorce, if the proceedings have not been
finalized he/she would still be, before the authorities and the law,
your spouse and thus have all the rights under intestacy law.

**Do children born out of wedlock or as a result of an affair have a
legitimate claim to the deceased’s estate?**

Both illegitimate and adopted children are not included in the intestacy
law rules. Thus under the current statutes they would not have a right
to inherit. In AGG v. Estate of AAH deceased [2009] SGCA 56, an
appellant seeking maintenance for her two daughters which where
illegitimate filed a claim for maintenances benefits. The Court
dismissed the appeal based on the fact neither the law nor English
precedents included them. Nevertheless the court did call for a change
in the law to include illegitimate children of a deceased person.

**Can physical abuse and/or harassment between beneficiaries affect
their entitlement to a proportion of an estate/assets? **

Wills can contain certain conditions in order to have the right to
receive the section of the estate allocated. Thus, if the testator
included clauses regarding good relations among the beneficiaries, their
share in the deceased estate could be compromised and reduced
accordingly in situations of abuse and/or harassment.

**Can I contest a Will?**

Yes. If there are any bases upon which the Validity of the Will can be
challenged, the beneficiaries may bring an action for total or partial
invalidation. Examples of the bases upon which the validity of the Will
can be challenged include the lack of fulfilment of formalities required
by the law, or that the deceased lacked mental capacity when the Will
was drafted.

However, it is important to remember there are certain protections that
the law grants to spouses and children in case the portion of the estate
allocated to them in the Will is not sufficient to provide for their
livelihood until they can fend for themselves.

**Can I contest the decision of an executor/administrator?**

Yes. The executor or administrator must perform his duties pursuant to
the instructions of the will and the rules of Administrators and Probate
act. Consequently, when the executor is overreaching its powers by
acting outside of the Will instructions or contrary to the rules of
intestacy, his decision can be contested in Court. Depending on the
effects of the challenged decision on the administration of the estate,
the Court would also consider the removal of the executor.

**Can a beneficiary argue for a greater share of the deceased’s estate,
other than what is specified to them in the will? **

The spouse and children of the deceased have a right pursuant to the
Inheritance (Family Provision) Act to be allocated a portion of the
estate of the deceased for them to secure a minimum welfare standard of
life. Thus if pursuant to the initial allocation of assets in the Will,
the Spouse and the Children are not allocated enough assets for them to
secure a minimum standard of living the spouse and children may apply to
the Court for a further share of the deceased's estate.

Apart from the above, the beneficiaries cannot argue for a bigger share
than what is contained in the Will unless he proves that the Will is
invalid.

**Can I take legal action against an executor or administrator refusing
to carry out their obligations?**

Yes. Any person who believes and has reasonable evidence that the
administrator or executor is not performing his duties pursuant to the
law or the instructions set out in the will can file a claim before the
Probate Court. For example, the executor could have acted without the
required care, or clearly against the law and orders of the Will. It is
important to provide evidentiary support for the allegations contained
in the claim, as otherwise it would be very hard to reverse an
appointment made in the Will or the Court.

**Can I be “trumped” by another beneficiary listed in the will – i.e.
can they take away my entitlement to the estate?**

If the deceased had nominated you under the **CPF Act**, you shall be
entitled to the funds in the deceased’s CPF account regardless of what
is stated in the latter’s Will.

Similarly, if you are **the spouse or child** of the deceased and a
nominated beneficiary under a **life insurance policy or NTUC Income
policy** taken out by the deceased, an implied “irrevocable” trust is
created and cannot be voided by a will. In other words, the policy is a
separate document and does not become part of the estate disposed of by
will regardless of what the Will states.

In the absence of nominations outside of the Will, the provisions of the
Will will be carried out according to the testator’s wishes, so it would
not be a matter of another beneficiary “trumping” your entitlement.

Under certain circumstances, a Will may be treated as invalid by a
court. In such cases, the deceased’s assets will not be distributed
according to the Will, and such assets may instead distributed according
to the Intestate Succession Act.

**Can someone “purchase” my entitlement to a deceased’s estate from
me?**

Distribution of the assets to the estate beneficiaries is the very last
step in the estate settlement process. Consequently, it is only after
settlement of the debts and other liabilities of the estate that
beneficiaries can receive their share of what remains, if any, of the
estate. At this point, and not before, the inheritance becomes your
personal asset, thus allowing you to enjoy the financial benefits, and
giving you the liberty to decide how to dispose of it, including selling
it to another person.

However, depending on the nature of the inherited property, there may
exist some restrictions on transfer, such as when a holding company had
been set up specifically to ensure that the shareholding is fairly
divided amongst your family members, and the shareholder’s agreement
provides that all shareholders are given the first right if any other
shareholder wants to sell their shares. This means that as a
shareholder, you may not be able to simply sell your inherited share
without first offering the same to the other shareholders.

**Can I recover money from a person who is now deceased?**

Even death does not wipe out debts. Settlement of debts has first
priority over estate distribution. It is only when all estate debts have
been settled, or in rare occasions forgiven, that the residual estate
can be distributed amongst beneficiaries.

As a creditor, you may lodge a caveat on the estate. Until all creditors
are satisfied that there are sufficient funds in the estate and there is
an undertaking from the estate’s legal representative to settle the debt
before distribution is present, the caveat will not be removed, and the
letter of administration or grant of probate will not be issued.

Be advised though, that if there is no formal IOU, it would be very
difficult for you to recover from the estate. The estate legal
representative is under no legal obligation to recognise such loans, let
alone settle it. However, if there is admissible evidence, like a
bounced cheque issued by the debtor shortly before he dies, you can file
a caveat on the estate.

(1) Inconsequence of the discovery of a will/codicil involving a
    substantial change in the disposition of the deceased’s estate

(2) In consequence of a question whether a person had an interest in the
    estate; or as to the nature of an interest in the estate, not having
    been determined at the time when representation was first taken out;
    or

(3) In consequence of some other circumstances affecting the
    administration or distribution of the estate.

DATA PROTECTION LAW
===================

Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (‘PDPA’)
------------------------------------------

The Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) fully came into force on 2 July
2014, which –

1. Establishes protection over the collection, use, disclosure, access
   and correction, and care of personal data belonging to individuals;

2. Provides for the establishment of the Do-Not-Call Registry (“DNC
   Registry”), at which individuals register their Singapore phone
   number to prevent marketers from sending them unsolicited mobile text
   messages, calls or faxes.

"Personal data" is data, whether true or not, about an individual.
Therefore, even false information can be considered “personal data”, if
it can be used to identify an individual.

The personal data must have "identifiability", in that an individual is
likely to be identified from that personal data, by a determined person
with a particular purpose to want to identify the individual.

The personal data should be significant in some sense; it should have
some value – monetary or otherwise.

What’s Excluded

1. Personal data in a record that has existed for at least one hundred
   (100) years;

2. Personal data about a deceased individual (except if the individual
   has been deceased for 10 years or less);

3. Business contact information, unless otherwise specifically
   mentioned. This is defined as as information which has not been
   provided by the individual solely for his personal purpose. Such
   information include an individual’s name, position name or title,
   business telephone number, business address, business electronic mail
   address or business fax number and any other similar information
   about the individual.

Limitation of Applicability

The following persons are not subject to compliance with the PDPA, and
will instead continue to be governed by existing common law -

1. Individuals acting in a domestic or personal capacity, by using
   personal data for purposes to do with personal, family or household
   affairs;

2. Public agency, or an entity acting on behalf of a public agency.

Data intermediaries are subject only to safeguarding and retention
provisions of the PDPA. Data intermediaries are defined as organisations
that processes personal data on behalf of another organisation but does
not include an employee of that other organisation.

"Processing" includes the following activities with respect to personal
data -

• recording

• holding

• organisation

• adaptation or alteration

• retrieval

• combination

• transmission

• erasure

• destruction

Obligations under the Law
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The PDPA recognises both (i) the right of the individual to protect
their personal data and (ii) the right of organizations to collect, use
or disclose personal data.

The latter right however, is qualified to the extent that the personal
data must be used for purposes deemed appropriate by a reasonable
person.

The following obligations are imposed on organizations which fall within
the ambit of the PDPA –

1. **Consent Obligation**

An individual must give consent for personal data to be collected, used
or disclosed. An individual must be allowed to withdraw consent, with
reasonable notice, and should be informed of the likely consequences of
such withdrawal.

Upon withdrawal of consent by the individual, their personal data can no
longer be collected, used or disclosed.

However, an individual can be *deemed* to provide his/her consent where
–

-  He voluntarily provided such personal data, and it is reasonable for
   him to do so;

-  He consents to the disclosure of his data from one company to another
   – he is deemed to have consented to the collection of his personal
   data by the second company.

The PDPA also provides for exceptions to receiving consent from the
individual, which include –

-  Where necessary to respond to an emergency threatening the life,
   health or safety of an individual;

-  To recover, or to pay a debt owed;

-  To manage or terminate an employment relationship;

-  Necessary in the national interest;

-  If inconsistent with other written laws, e.g. under the Banking Act
   banks do not need to obtain the consent of an individual prior to
   disclosing customer information for the purpose of an application for
   a grant of probate.

1. **Purpose Limitation Obligation**

The organization can only collect use or disclose personal data for the
purpose that the individual has given consent for.

The organisation cannot, as a condition of providing a service, require
the individual to give consent for use beyond what is reasonably needed
for providing such service.

1. **Notification Obligation**

Individuals must be notified of the purpose for which the organisation
is collecting using or disclosing their personal data, before the
organization proceeds to collect, use or disclose the individual’s
personal data.

1. **Access and Correction Obligation**

If so requested, an organisation must provide to an individual, his/her
personal data and the ways in which it has been used or disclosed in the
past year. The organization can levy a reasonable charge for an access
request.

Furthermore, an organisation should correct any errors or omission in
personal data upon the individual’s request. The organization cannot
charge the individual for a correction request.

However, organisations are prevented from providing access if the
provision of the data may:

-  Cause immediate or grave harm to the safety or physical or mental
   health of the individual;

-  Threaten the safety or physical or mental health of another
   individual;

-  Reveal personal data about another individual

-  Reveal the identity of the person who has provided the personal data
   about the individual , and the person has not consented to the
   disclosure of his or her identity;

-  Is contrary to national interest.

1. **Accuracy Obligation**

Personal data collected by the organisation must be reasonably accurate
and complete.

1. **Protection Obligation**

The organisation must implement security measures to protect, and
control or prevent unauthorised use of personal data.

1. **Retention Limitation Obligation**

Personal data and the means by which it can be associated with the
individual, should no longer be retained if it is no longer necessary
for any business or legal purposes.

There is no specific retention period, but an individual can tell an
organisation to stop collecting, using or disclosing their personal data
at any time. However, the organisation is not required to delete or
destroy personal data and may retain it for as long as there are
business or legal needs. 

1. **Transfer Limitation Obligation**

An organisation must ensure that personal data is protected by measures
comparable to those provided under the PDPA when transferring personal
data outside of Singapore.

1. **Openness Obligation**

The organization must, upon request, make available information about
data protection policies, practices and complaints process.

A data protection officer must be designated to implement personal data
protection policies within the organisation. The business contact
information of the data protection officer should be made available to
the public; however the responsibility of complying with the PDPA
remains the organisation’s responsibility.

Penalties
~~~~~~~~~

If found to be in non-compliance, organizations may face financial
penalties of up to S$1 million and additional liabilities in terms of
private rights of action against organisations in breach.

Do-Not-Call Registry (DNC Registry)
-----------------------------------

Organizations are required to check whether a Singapore telephone number is registered with the DNC Registry prior to sending telemarketing messages, calls, or faxes.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Marketing messages are those which, among others –

-  Offer, advertise or promote goods or services, or the supplier of
   such goods or services;

-  Offer, advertise or promote land or an interest in land, or the
   supplier of such land or an interest in land;

-  Offer, advertise or promote a business or investment opportunity, or
   the supplier of such business or investment opportunity.

Types of messages which are excluded from provisions under the PDPA
relating to the DNC Registry include –

-  Non-commercial nature, such as service calls or reminders;

-  Market survey or research calls;

-  Promotion of charitable or religious purpose;

-  Business-to-business telemarketing calls.

There are 3 DNC Registers –

1. No Voice Call Register

2. No Text Message Register

3. No Fax Message Register

Results from the DNC Registry are valid only for 30 days, after which
the organisation must re-apply to check if a telephone number is
registered.

It must be noted that an organisation can continue sending marketing
messages to an individual where there is an "ongoing relationship". An
ongoing relationship is the conduct of a business or activity
(commercial or otherwise) by the organization for the individual, such
as a subscription, membership, account or loan . A series of one-off
transactions or a past relationship is not sufficient to constitute an
ongoing relationship. However, the organisation must allow the
individual to opt out of receiving marketing messages, if he/she so
wishes.

Limitations of the DNC Registry
-------------------------------

Only Singapore telephone numbers can be registered with the DNC
Registry. An organization cannot therefore contact the individual using
smartphone applications which use telephone numbers as an identifier,
such as Whatsapp.

However, smartphone applications which use an identifier other than a
telephone number, are not covered by the PDPA e.g. iMessage uses an
email address as an identifier, hence marketing messages can be sent by
iMessage, as the email address cannot be registered with the DNC
Registry.

Similarly, email is not included within the scope of the DNC Registry.
However, individuals can use email filters to manage their junk or spam
email.

Breach of the PDPA
------------------

A complaint can be lodged with the PDPC for investigations by providing
the following information:

1. Your particulars (name, NRIC, contact number, etc)

2. The date and approximate time of the call/text/fax you received

3. The Singapore telephone number on which you received the
   call/text/fax

4. If available, the name and telephone number of the person that made
   or sent the call/text/fax

5. If available, the name of the organisation on whose behalf the
   call/text/fax was made or sent (for example, the caller/sender may be
   employed by one company but made the call/text/fax on behalf of
   another company)

6. If available, the contact details (such as a website or telephone or
   fax number) of the organisation involved

7. Contents of the call/text/fax (where applicable, to attach a copy of
   the message received)

8. Whether you have any ongoing relationship (e.g. membership,
   subscription) with the organisation

9. Whether you recall having withdrawn consent from that organisation to
   contact you

The above information should be sent to the PDPC through any of the
following channels:

1. Email: info@pdpc.gov.sg, with the subject title as [Enforcement]

2. Telephone: 6377 3131

3. Post: 

    Attn: Officer-in-charge, Enforcement,

    Personal Data Protection Commission

    460 Alexandra Road 

    #10-02 PSA Building 

    Singapore 119963

1. Fax: 6274 7370

Supporting information such as the below should be provided when making
the complaint -

1. Screenshots of the message (including the message date and time of
   the message)

2. Call logs of the telephone number that made the telemarketing call

3. The original fax message received

4. Documents showing that you have withdrawn consent from receiving
   telemarketing messages/calls from the organisation concerned

However, a complaint can be made even if documentary evidence is not
available provided there is sufficient evidence for the PDPC to
investigate further.

The individual may be expected to make a police statement and/or attend
Court, if necessary.

*Offer of Moneylending Services*

Under the Moneylenders Act, licensed moneylenders are not allowed to
advertise their moneylending services via SMS or voice calls. Therefore,
any SMSes or calls soliciting for loans are either sent by a licensed
moneylender in contravention of advertising restrictions, or by an
unlicensed moneylender.

The SMS (with a screen capture of the SMS you received) should be
reported at:

(a) the `Electronic Police Centre <http://www.spf.gov.sg/epc/>`__;

(b) the National Crime Prevention Council's 'X Ah Long' Hotline at
1800-924-5664 (1800-X-AH-LONG);

ADVANCE MEDICAL DIRECTIVE
=========================

Introduction

The **“Advance Medical Directive Act”** is (Chapter 4A, 1997 Revised
Edition) is the law to *“provide for, and give legal effect to, advance
directives to medical practitioners against artificial prolongation of
the dying process and for matters connected therewith.*\ ”

An Advance Medical Directive ("AMD") is a legal document signed by a
person in advance, which informs the doctor that he objects to the use
of extraordinary life-sustaining treatment to prolong his life where he
becomes terminally ill and unconscious or incapable of exercising
rational judgment.

"Extraordinary lifesaving treatment" is any medical procedure or measure
which only prolongs the process of dying when death is imminent, when
administered to a terminally-ill patient. Palliative care is excluded.

"Terminal illness" is defined as an incurable condition caused by injury
or disease from which there is no reasonable prospect of a temporary or
permanent recovery.

Creating an Advance Medical Directive
-------------------------------------

An AMD can be created at any time by any person, who is -

1. 21 years or older;

2. Of sound mental mind.

To be valid, the AMD must be in the prescribed form, which can be
obtained from clinics, polyclinics, hospitals or the Ministry of Health
website) -

1. In writing;

2. Witnessed by two (2) witnesses, one of which must be a doctor
   registered with the Singapore Medical Council and the other must be
   at least 21 years old;

3. Returned to the Registrar of AMD, Ministry of Health upon completion.

Further, both witnesses cannot have any vested interests in the death of
the creator of the AMD. The witnesses must not -

• Be a beneficiary of the will or any insurance policy taken out by the
creator of the AMD;

• Have any interest under any instrument of which the creator of the AMD
is a donor, settlor or grantor;

• Be entitled as an intestate beneficiary to the estate of the creator
of the AMD;

• Be entitled to an interest in the CPF or other provident fund
belonging to the creator of the AMD; and

• Have registered an objection to the AMD.

A relative to the creator of the AMD can be a witness, as long as he
does not have any vested interests as listed above.

How an AMD works
----------------

The AMD is confidential and will not be disclosed to anyone, except if
the creator of the AMD has authorised specific persons in writing.

An AMD is activated in the event the creator of the AMD is -

1. Suffering from a terminal illness;

2. Unconscious or incapable of exercising rational judgment;

3. To the point where he/she is unable to communicate his/her wishes to
   the doctor.

The doctor will then check the AMD Registry to see if an AMD has been
registered. If so, extraordinary life-sustaining treatment will not be
applied or given to the creator of the AMD.

An AMD is confidential, and therefore the doctor cannot ask their
patient whether or not an AMD has been created.

To determine whether a patient is "terminally ill" -

1. Three doctors, including the doctor who is responsible for the
   treatment of the patient, must unanimously certify that the patient
   is terminally ill;

2. At least 2 out of the 3 doctors must be specialists;

3. If these doctors cannot unanimously agree, then the matter is
   referred for determination to a committee of 3 specialists appointed
   by the Director of Medical Services from among the panel of
   specialists appointed by the Minister;

4. If the second panel of 3 doctors cannot unanimously agree, the
   patient shall be presumed not to be terminally ill and the AMD will
   not take effect.

Revoking an AMD
---------------

An AMD can be revoked at any time in the presence of at least one
witness, by -

1. Completing the AMD revocation form; or

2. Writing a letter to the Registrar of AMD to revoke it.

If the creator of the AMD is unable to write, the AMD can be revoked
orally or in any other way in which he can communicate. It is then the
responsibility of the witness to the revocation to submit the notice of
revocation using the revocation form or the letter. The witness should
also state the reason why the person revoking the AMD could not do so
himself.

JUVENILE ISSUES
===============

Definitions & Age Ranges
------------------------

Definitions

**Child (< 14):** A “child” in Singapore is defined in the Children and
Young Persons Act (Cap. 38) as “a person who is below the age of 14
years”. [250]_

**Juvenile (7 to <16):** A “juvenile” in Singapore is defined in the Act
as “a male or female person who is 7 years of age or above and below the
age of 16 years”. [251]_

**Young person (14 to <16):** A “young person” is defined in the Act as

under 7 years of age.” [253]_

**Qualified immunity from criminal liability (>7 to <12):** The Penal
Code provides that “[n]othing is an offence which is done by a child
above 7 years of age and under 12, who has not attained sufficient
maturity of understanding to judge of the nature and consequence of his
conduct on that occasion.” [254]_

Jurisdiction of the Youth Court (*formerly Juvenile Court*)

**By age**

Only a child, juvenile or young person (age to be determined at the date
of commencement of the hearing of the charge) may be brought before the
Juvenile Court to be tried for an offence. [255]_

The Act provides that “no child or young person [i.e. nobody under 16
years of age] shall be charged with or tried for any offence by court of
summary jurisdiction except a Juvenile Court”, [256]_ unless:

-  He/she is jointly charged with another person who is 16 years of age
   or above [257]_

-  He/she is charged with any offence triable only by the High Court,
   and (a) the Public Prosecutor has not applied to the Juvenile Court
   to try such offence or (b), if the Public Prosecutor has made such an
   application, the legal representative of the child/young person has
   not consented to the offence being tried by the Juvenile
   Court. [258]_

*Types of cases/issues*

The Juvenile Court, or the Juvenile Justice Division of the State
Courts, deals with: [259]_

-  Beyond Parental Control (“BPC”) cases

-  Juvenile Arrest Cases (“JAC”)

-  Care & Protection Order (“CPO”) cases

Beyond Parental Control
-----------------------

Basic Information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Beyond Parental Control (“BPC”) refers to a child or young person below
the age of 16 years who may be: [260]_

(1) In persistent conflict with his/her parent(s) and school or other
authorities **and/or**

(2) Displaying at-risk behaviour.

There has usually been a breakdown in the relationship and communication
between the child/young person and his/her parent(s). It may result in
the inability of the parent(s) to exercise care and control over the
child/young person. In these circumstances, the parent(s) can apply to
the Juvenile Court for a BPC order. [261]_

**Requirement of Proof:** The Court only makes a BPC order if the parent
can prove to the satisfaction of the Court that the child is beyond
parental control. The parent will have to first go through Pre-Complaint
Counselling with the child. This is conducted by the Singapore
Children's Society at the Juvenile Court.

Procedure For Parents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Step 1: Lodging a complaint**\  [262]_

The parent can lodge a complaint at the Juvenile Court from 2pm to 4pm
on Fridays, except on public holidays.

To lodge a complaint, the parent is required to bring their child along.
In the event that the parent is unable to do so, the Magistrate may
issue a warrant of arrest with no bail for the child to be brought to
the Juvenile Court.

The parent must bring the following documents:

-  The child’s Birth Certificate (either the original or photocopy).

-  The child’s Identity Card, if possible.

-  The Custody and Access Order, if the parents are divorced.

**Step 2: Pre-complaint counselling**

Before the complaint is sworn, the parents and the child will be
attended to by a Social Worker from the Singapore Children's Society who
will try to resolve the matter without the intervention of the
Court. [263]_ In the meantime, the case will be adjourned for 4 weeks
pending the outcome of the counselling sessions. [264]_

In the event that Court intervention is still necessary, the Magistrate
will confirm that the parent is proceeding with the complaint before
calling for a Social Report on the child. Pending the preparation of the
Social Report, the Court may remand the child either in a Place of
Detention (either the Singapore Boys’ Home or the Toa Payoh Girls’
Home). [265]_

The parent will be informed of the date to return to Court when the
Court will make the appropriate orders. [266]_

**Step 3: Return to Court**\  [267]_

The parent must bring the child along on the return date. The Magistrate
and 2 Panel Advisers to the Juvenile Court will discuss and consider the
Social Report on the child.

Subject to the parent’s consent, the child may be ordered to:

-  Be sent to an Approved Home for not less than 2 and not more than 3
   years; or

-  Be placed on statutory supervision under the supervision of a Social
   Worker for a specified period not exceeding 3 years.

**Step 4: Consequences of breaching an order**

**Breach proceedings**

If the child fails to comply with any of the given orders, the Social
Worker will initiate breach proceedings against the child.

If the child is not in Court, a warrant of arrest will be issued. When
the warrant is executed and the juvenile is brought before the Court,
the Court will explain the substance of the complaint and elicit a reply
from the child and parent.

The Magistrate will call for a progress report on the child and fix a
date to consider the outcome of the breach. The child may be remanded
pending the production of the progress report.

**Court orders**

If the child is a resident of an Approved Home, the Court may order the
child to be transferred to another Approved Home and be detained there
for the whole or any part of the unexpired period of detention.

If the child is under statutory supervision, the Court may, on the
hearing date, make the following orders after considering the Social
Report and that it is in the best interest of the child to do so:

-  Discharge the child back to the parent.

-  Make a fresh statutory supervision order.

-  Order the child to be sent to an Approved Home for a minimum of 2
   years and a maximum of 3 years.

**
**\ Commonly Asked Questions On Going Beyond Parental Control
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Will the Juvenile Court be monitoring the child?**

The Juvenile Court does review BPC cases from time to time if there is a
need for close monitoring of the Juvenile. If and when the
pre-delinquent Child or Young Person fails to comply with an order of
statutory supervision, the Social Worker from Singapore Children's
Society may institute a complaint in Court. The juvenile and his Parents
are given an opportunity to explain and respond to these complaints. The
Court may remand the juvenile pending a progress report.

**Are there any programmes in place for BPC children/young persons?**

The Counselling And Psychological Services (“CAPS”) of the State Courts
introduced the BPC Family Conferencing programme to strengthen family
units, empower parents and the community to regain control of the
juveniles, encourage the juvenile to take responsibility for his
behaviour, reduce the placement of such juveniles in institutions
accommodating offenders and reduce the likelihood of the juvenile
committing an offence.

**Can the child or ex-spouse appeal the Court Order?**

Any child or young person or his parent or guardian who is dissatisfied
with any judgment or order of a Juvenile Court may appeal to the High
Court, in accordance with the provision of any law regulating appeals to
the High Court from a Magistrate’s Court (such as deadlines). [268]_

Youth Arrest Cases
------------------

Case Flow Outline [269]_

|image7|

The details on specific stages in the Case Flow Outline can be found in
the following sections. Refer to the relevant sections in this chapter
for more information on the Pre-Sentence Report stage, Court Orders, and
the Family Conferencing stage.

Commonly Asked Questions on Pre-Sentence Report
-----------------------------------------------

**GENERAL QUESTIONS**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**What is a Pre-Sentence Report? **

A Pre-Sentence Report is a report that gives information to the Court
about the juvenile and whether he/she can benefit from being placed on
probation under the supervision of a Probation Officer. The Report is
put up when the Court calls for it after a juvenile has been convicted
of an offence, and before the sentence or order is imposed.

**Why does the Court order a Pre-Sentence Report? **

The Pre-Sentence Report will help the Court understand the needs of the
juvenile and determine whether probation is in his/her best interest to
help him/her make positive changes. It should be noted that while the
Probation Officers make recommendations on the juvenile's suitability
for probation, it is ultimately the Court that decides on the sentence
or order. Besides calling for a Pre-Sentence Report, the Court can also
call for other reports such as medical or psychological reports.

**Who prepares the Pre-Sentence Report? **

The Pre-Sentence Report is prepared by trained Probation Officers from
MSF or volunteers who have been qualified as Gazetted Volunteer
Probation Officers. These officers are gazetted under the Probation of
Offenders Act.

**FOR JUVENILE OFFENDERS**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**What does the offender have to do if told that a Pre-Sentence Report
will be prepared? **

Once the Court calls for a Pre-Sentence Report, the offender will have
to proceed to the Probation Intake Office on the 5th floor of the
Subordinate Courts' Complex to provide the Court Liaison Officer with
basic information to help them gather the relevant information about the
offender.

The Probation Officer will contact the offender and his parents/guardian
within 3 working days from the court appearance to arrange for an
interview. If the offender does not hear from the Probation office by
then, he may call the info-line at 1800-258-7963 to make enquiries. The
offender will be required to provide his I/C number to help the
Probation officer trace his case file.

**What will the Probation Officer ask? **

The Probation Officer will speak to the offender about his lifestyle,
family background, education and/or employment history, hobbies,
friends, any previous Court appearances and all the circumstances
surrounding the offence(s).

The officer may also want to talk to other people who know the offender,
such as family members, teachers or employers, counsellors (if any) who
may have counselled the offender in the past or any relevant persons. It
is important that the offender be truthful and co-operate with the
Probation Officer from the beginning to avoid a lengthy investigation
process.

Court Orders
------------

The Juvenile Court has the power to make orders for juveniles: [270]_

-  When an offence has been proven

-  When the juvenile admits the facts constituting the offence under
   Section 44(1) of the Children and Young Persons Act

Considerations Of The Court [271]_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Juvenile Court takes into consideration every individual offender’s
strengths and limitations when making its orders. In broad terms, the
factors that the Juvenile Court considers include:

-  Rehabilitation and reformation of the offender.

-  Removal of him/her from undesirable surroundings.

-  Promoting his/her education and welfare.

-  Compensation of victim(s) involved.

-  Protection of the public.

-  Minimising the risk of further offending by the offender.

-  Punishment of the offender.

**Step 1: Dealing with juvenile offenders**\  [272]_

The Juvenile Court is empowered with the following options (explained
below) to deal with a juvenile offender upon a finding of guilt under
Section 44 of the Act:

**(a) Discharging the offender**

The offender may be granted an absolute or conditional discharge. An
absolute discharge is rarely made. A conditional discharge is one where
the offender is discharged on condition that he does not commit any
offences within a prescribed period (maximum 12 months). The offender
may be conditionally discharged upon his entering into a bond to ensure
good behaviour.

**(b) Committing the offender to the care of a relative or other fit
person**

The Court may commit the offender to the care of a relative or fit
person for aspecified period of time if it deems that the offender will
be better cared for and supervised by that relative or fit person.

**(c) Offender's parent or guardian to execute a bond to exercise proper
care and guardianship**

This order is usually made in conjunction with a Probation Order. An
appropriate monetary value ordered by the Magistrate will constitute the
bond.

**(d) Community service order**

The Court may require the offender to perform community service for a
specified duration of to 240 hours. This order is usually made in
conjunction with a Probation Order.

**(e) Probation order**

A probation order places the offender under the supervision of a
Probation Officer from the Ministry of Social and Family Development
(“MSF”) for a period of not less than 6 months and not more than 3
years.

**Conditions and requirements**

The Court may attach conditions to the probation order that it thinks
necessary for securing the good conduct of the offender or preventing
him from re-offending. Such additional conditions can include residence
in an Approved Institution.

An additional requirement for residence is normally made for juveniles
who have an unsatisfactory home environment but who otherwise satisfy
the usual requirements for probation. The maximum duration of residence
at an Approved Institution is 12 months. Probationers who are ordered to
reside at an approved institution are permitted to work or pursue their
education in schools outside the confines of the institution after an
initial period of one month at the institution.

The following institutions are gazetted as Approved Institutions:

-  Singapore Boys’ Hostel (for males only)

-  Bukit Batok Hostel (for older males who are aged above 16 but placed
   on probation before turning 16)

-  Salvation Army Gracehaven (for non-Muslim females only)

-  Pertapis Adolescent Development Centre (for Muslim males only)

-  Pertapis Centre For Women and Girls (for Muslim females only)

-  Muhammiyah Welfare Home (for Muslim females only)

The Court may also make an order of residence in a non-gazetted home if
the pre-sentence report shows that the institution is prepared to accept
the offender. The Hiding Place, Singapore Boys’ Town and Teen Challenge
are voluntary institutions that accept male juveniles with delinquency
problems that are not deep-seated. At Teen Challenge, the programme that
the probationer has to undergo lasts 18 months.

**Classification of probation orders**

Operationally, probation orders have been classified into 3 grades to
cater for the varying intensity of risks and needs of the individual
probationers. These are:

-  Administrative Probation

-  Supervised Probation

-  Intensive Probation

**Additional orders**

These orders may be made in addition to the probation order:

-  Committing the offender to the care of a relative or other fit
   person.

-  Offender's Parent or Guardian to execute a bond to exercise proper
   care and Guardianship.

-  Community service order.

-  Detention at a Place of Detention (if detention order is made with
   Probation order, detention will be up to 3 months).

-  Weekend Detention at a Place of Detention or Approved Institution (up
   to 52 weekends).

-  Payment of a fine, damages or costs.

**(f) Detention at a “Place of Detention”**

The offender may be detained for a period of up to 6 months. The
following are gazetted as Places of Detention:

-  Singapore Boys’ Home (for males only)

-  Toa Payoh Girls’ Home (for females only)

Under this order, offenders will be required to be resident at the Place
of Detention for a specified period of time as ordered by the Court.

The following orders may also be made in addition to the Detention at a
Place of Detention order:

-  Offender's Parent or Guardian to execute a bond to exercise proper
   care and Guardianship

-  Probation order

**(g) Weekend detention at a “Place of Detention” or Approved
Institution**

The Court may order that the offender be detained in a Place of
Detention or an Approved Institution over a specified number of weekends
– up to 52 weekends. During the specified period, the offender is able
to pursue his/her education or go to work and attend school during the
weekdays.

However, they will be detained at Singapore Boys’ Home (for males only)
or Toa Payoh Girls’ Home (for females only) during the weekends from 3pm
on Saturday to 5pm on Sunday for the specified number of weekends.

The following orders may be made in addition to the Weekend Detention
order:

-  Committing the offender to the care of a relative or other fit person

-  Offender's Parent or Guardian to execute a bond to exercise proper
   care and Guardianship

-  Community service order

-  Probation order

-  Payment of a fine, damages or costs

-

**(h) Approved School order**

The Juvenile Court may commit offenders to an Approved School. Such
orders areusually meted out for juveniles with pronounced delinquency.
Juveniles who commit serious offences, exhibit a cavalier attitude
towards community-based supervision or have strong associations with
highly undesirable peers are normally sent to an Approved School regime
for a period of not more than 3 years.

This regime provides a structured and controlled environment in which to
rehabilitate the offender. There are facilities in all Approved Schools
to cater either "in-house" or outside the institution depending on the
offender's behaviour, to the offender's academic or vocational needs.
Depending on their behaviour and responses to the rehabilitation
programmes, residents in these institutions may be granted home leave
during weekends and be allowed to return to their schools and employment
after a period of initial stay, which is usually about 9 months.

**Approved Schools**

Both voluntary welfare organisations (“VWOs”) and MSF manage Approved
Schools.

There are presently two Approved Schools run by VWOs that meet the
specific rehabilitative needs of the offenders. These are:

-  Salvation Army, Gracehaven (for non-Muslims)

-  Muhammadiyah Welfare Home (for Muslims)

There are presently two Approved Schools run by MSF. These are:

-  Singapore Boys’ Home (“SBH”) (for males)

-  Toa Payoh Girls’ Home (“TPGH”) (for females)

Juveniles who are sent to SBH or TPGH exhibit a greater degree of
delinquency and possess more/greater risk factors compared to those sent
to Salvation Army Gracehaven or Muhammadiyah Welfare Home.

**(i) Reformative Training Centre**

The Prisons Department of the Ministry of Home Affairs runs the
Reformative Training Centre. Offenders here do not enjoy the privilege
of home-leave.

Where the offender is between the ages of 14 and 16, or has attained 16
years, and the Court is satisfied that it is expedient with a view to
his/her reformation that he/she should undergo a period of training in a
reformative training centre, it may order him to be brought before a
District Court to be considered for reformative training.

This order is normally made after the juvenile has committed a breach
for unruly behaviour in an Approved School regime.

**(j) Payment of a fine, damages or costs**

Offenders may be asked to make reparation to society by way of a fine or
to the victim by an award of damages. This order is rarely made alone
and is normally coupled with a probation order.

In the case of a child (below 14 years old) or young person (14 years
old and above, but below 16 years old), the parents/guardians will be
ordered to pay this on behalf of the child. Such an order will not be
made against the parents/guardians if the Court is satisfied that the
parents/guardians cannot be found or that they have not conduced the
commission of the offence by neglecting to exercise due care over the
child/young person.

**Stage 2: Review of cases**\  [273]_

**(a) Court-ordered probation review**

Apart from the 6-monthly reviews, the Juvenile Court may decide to place
selected probation cases for review very shortly after making the
probation order. The period could be 1 to 3 months after the probation
order. This is to ensure that such cases are very closely monitored and
remedial actions enforced should the probationer manifest any intention
not to cherish the opportunity to be rehabilitated.

**(b) Advisory Board review**

Residents' progress in the Approved Schools and Approved Homes regime
are assessed at the meetings of the Advisory Board, a body constituted
by the Minister of Community Development and Sports to review such
residents. Such meetings are held once every 2 months. The Juvenile
Court Magistrate is an ex officio member of this Board. The Director of
Social Welfare, on the advice of the Advisory Board, may release the
residents on licence after they have completed 12 months in the Approved
Schools / Approved Homes regime.

**Stage 3 (if applicable): Breach of Court Order**\  [274]_

Residents in the Approved Schools and Approved Homes may be in breach
for unruly behaviour. The test is whether the resident is so unruly a
character that he/she cannot be so detained in the Approved School or
Home. Such behaviour includes bullying other residents, fighting and
abscondance. The manager of a Place of Detention, an Approved School or
an Approved Home can initiate breach proceedings against a resident, to
the Juvenile Court.

The resident is offered an opportunity to explain himself or engage a
counsel to do so to the Court. The Court, if satisfied that there is
justification for the breach action, will call for a progress report on
the resident and fix the case for consideration before the Juvenile
Court.

If the Juvenile Court is satisfied that the Young Person is so unruly as
to be unfit to reside at the present institution, it is empowered to
mete out the following orders pursuant to Section 44(7) of the Children
and Young Persons Act:

-  Order the resident to be transferred to another Approved School that
   the Court considers more suitable, and detain the resident there for
   the unexpired period of detention (for example, an unruly female
   resident may be transferred from the Salvation Army Gracehaven to the
   Toa Payoh Girls' Home).

-  If a resident is between 14 and 16 years of age, he/she may be
   brought before a District Court and sent to the Reformative Training
   Centre.

However, it is also open to the Court in the appropriate case to give
the young person a stern warning with respect to his behaviour and
direct him to continue his present detention.

**
**\ Family Conferencing
-----------------------

Under Section 45(1) of the Children and Young Persons Act, the Juvenile
Court Magistrate may order that a juvenile case conference be convened
to deal with an offender found guilty of an offence. This order is made
if in respect of the offender's family background, general conduct, home
surroundings, school record, medical history and state of development of
the offender, the Court is satisfied that it would be in the best
interests of the offender that he/she be dealt with by a juvenile case
conference. [275]_

Participants
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The parties convened by the Magistrate will vary according to the needs
of each juvenile case conference. The participants of a conference may
include the following:

-  Facilitator

-  Offender

-  Parent(s) or guardian(s)

-  Extended family

-  Victim(s)

-  Victim’s family

-  Offender’s school teacher, principal and/or employer

-  Prosecutor and/or Police Investigating Officer

-  Probation (Welfare) Officer, Case Worker and/or Psychologist

-  Other relevant persons.

Objectives [276]_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Objectives of these juvenile case conferences include:

-  Reprimanding the offender.

-  Administering a formal caution to the offender.

-  Requiring the offender to pay compensation to the victim(s) of the
   offence.

-  Requiring the offender to apologise to the victim(s) of the offence.

-  Resolving any relationship problems between the child/young person
   and the parent/guardian, which should aid the rehabilitation of the
   juvenile.

-  Requiring the offender to do such other acts as the juvenile case
   conference thinks appropriate in the circumstances.

Court Orders
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The results and recommendations of the juvenile case conference are made
to the Magistrate who then makes appropriate orders in open Court. If it
is deemed appropriate, under Section 46(1) of the Act the Court may make
an additional order requiring either or both the child/young person and
the parent/guardian thereof to undergo counselling, psychotherapy or
other appropriate programmes.

After the conference, you and your child will wait at the waiting area
of the Juvenile Court before the case is mentioned in the Juvenile
Court. The Magistrate will then make an order on your child's case. The
options available to the Court are:

-  Discharge

-  Discharge with good behaviour bond

-  Commit to a relative or fit person for a specified period

-  Parent/guardian to enter bond to exercise proper care and supervision

-  Probation

-  Detention in a Place of Detention (up to 6 months)

-  Approved School order (between 2-3 years)

-  Fine, damages, or costs

-  Transfer to a District Court for a reformatory training order, if it
   is expedient to your child's reformation that such an order is made
   (certain conditions will have to be met before such an order is made
   if your child is above 14 years old and below 16 years old)

**
**\ Commonly Asked Questions on Court Orders & Family Conferencing
------------------------------------------------------------------

**How does the offender appeal a court order? **

Any child/ young person or his parent/guardian who is dissatisfied with
any judgment or order of a Juvenile Court may appeal to the High
Court. [277]_

Appeals must be in accordance with the provision of any law in force for
the time being regulating appeals to the High Court from a Magistrate’s
Court, [278]_ which means that the appeal must be filed with the Crime
Registry of the State Courts within 14 days from the time the judgment,
sentence or order is made. [279]_

**How can a parent help the child remain on the right track after the
Court Order? **

The real test on the child's sincerity for change comes after the Court
has made an order for his/her case. The child needs to have the
determination for a change as well as your continued support. Be
sensitive to the child's needs but keep boundaries and rules intact.

Attending parenting workshops and talks may be useful. A parent can get
a copy of these from the information counter of the Family Court,
various social service centres, family service centres or from the
Ministry of Social and Family Development. Counselling for the parent
and child at various family service centres will also assist in the
child's rehabilitative needs.

**What happens at the Juvenile Case Conference? **

Knowing that the child has committed an offence can be a difficult or
embarrassing thing to accept for many parents. Sometimes the juveniles
may not know how their parents feel about their offence, the impact it
has on a victimor the level of responsibility needed for wayward
actions. There is a need for confrontation, reprimand, reconciliation,
and resolution of key issues or counselling which furthers
rehabilitation.

The Juvenile Court is not only a Court that metes out punishment for
crime but also focuses on the restoration of an offender and his / her
family. Restorative justice aims towards the ultimate reintegration of a
sound young person into a functional family.

Together with the juvenile and his/her family, participants will examine
the formulation of the rehabilitation process including the possible
commencement of additional counselling, psychotherapy or other programme
deemed appropriate in future.

The facilitator guides, sums up and closes the conference. Ultimately,
it is the Magistrate of Juvenile Court itself who decides on all orders
to be imposed.

**How effective is a Juvenile Case Conference?**

Between 1994 and 2000, 144 cases underwent Family Conferencing (as it
was called then). 53% of them were for thefts. Only a mere 6% reoffended
over this period, with no records of re-offending in some years. The
study showed that the juvenile's family members, his/her extended
family, and his/her schoolteachers contributed to his/her
rehabilitation.

In two studies in 1995 and 1997, surveys were conducted to evaluate the
impact of Family Conferencing on juvenile offenders and their family
members. The results showed that both juveniles and their family members
have benefited from the programme. In many cases, the juvenile and his
family realised the seriousness of his offending behaviour. The Family
Conference offered the offender an opportunity to accept responsibility
qua the victim. The offender and his Parents improved their relationship
with one another. Parents also indicated that Family Conferencing helped
them realise the needs of the juveniles. With the aid of the
facilitators they were able to identify areas to work on.

**
**\ Restorative Programmes
--------------------------

Counselling And Psychological Services (CAPS)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The CAPS of the State Courts coordinates and brings together the formal
and informal juvenile justice constituents in the rehabilitation of the
juvenile offender and youths at risk. It works out programmes for
juveniles and their families with an emphasis to re-integrate the
juvenile back to his/her family and community in line with the
Restorative Justice Model adopted by the Juvenile Justice System. [280]_

Personal and specialised attention is paid to each juvenile offender,
his character, his family and environment for a holistic approach to
rehabilitation. In additionCAPS, in its planning of restorative
programmes, also looks at the larger issue of educating the general
public and community on pertinent issues that underscore delinquency and
crime recidivism. [281]_

Programmes established should not only teach juvenile delinquents and
offenders basic life skills and afford them employability and
self-sustenance without resorting to crime. In addition, the juvenile's
family and community of care should be targeted as well. Thus the
Juvenile Court, CAPS and its constituent stakeholders actively seek to
tap all available community resources as meaningful options that targets
at underlying causes of delinquency, resulting in meaningful
re-orientation of values and eroding causes of recidivism. The approach
seeks to equip young offenders and delinquents with the resources and
life skills to embark on more constructive lifestyles. [282]_

Streetwise Programme [283]_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Streetwise Programme is a government-funded project initiated by the
Inter-Ministry Committee on Youth Crime and is coordinated by the
National Youth Council (“NYC”). There are 4 youth agencies which work in
collaboration with the NYC in administering this programme.

The Juvenile Court refers certain offenders to this developmental
programme as a condition of their probation which aims at changing the
behaviour of youths who have unwittingly drifted into gangs. It is an
intensive 6-month structured programme that incorporates elements of
counselling, family conferencing, peer support, recreation and academic
activities. The programme aims to help these youths “turn their lives
around” and gain a fresh start.

Youth Family Care Programme [284]_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Youth Family Care ("YFC") Programme is run by CAPS and the Singapore
Children's' Society. A large number of delinquent youths who come under
the supervision of the Juvenile Court come from broken and dysfunctional
families where there are often no adequate family role models. Through
YFC, volunteer Mentor Families are matched to befriend, mentor, support
and encourage young persons placed on probation or statutory supervision
as well as to provide hope and modelling for healthy families that work.
It is targeted at helping juvenile offenders and children who are beyond
parental control who have little family support, who are remorseful
about their past misdeeds and do not have ingrained delinquent traits.

Beyond Parental Control Family Conferencing [285]_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Beyond Parental Control ("BPC") Family Conferencing philosophy is
similar to that of the Family Conferencing for offenders except that it
is targeted at juveniles who are BPC. It was introduced to strengthen
family units, empower parents and the community to regain control of the
juveniles, encourage the juvenile to take responsibility for his
behaviour, reduce the placement of such juveniles in institutions
accommodating offenders and reduce the likelihood of the juvenile
committing an offence.

School-Probation-Courts Link-Up [286]_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This programme, implemented on 1 July 2000, institutionalizes the role
of Operations Managers ("OMs") in schools within the rehabilitative
framework of a Probation Order. OMs hold non-teaching posts in schools
and handle school administrative operations including disciplinary
issues. Under this programme, the OM will be the contact person for all
probationers' matters, including contributing or assisting the Probation
Officer during the pre-sentence investigation stage and drawing up the
supervision plan should probation be granted. This improves the
communication and follow-up channels between the schools and the Courts
in probation matters.

Peer Mediation Programme [287]_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The philosophy behind introducing peer mediation in schools is to nip
disciplinary problems in the bud before they escalate into behaviour
that requires intervention by schools, police or the Courts. This is
done by imparting practical skills to students in the management and
resolution of conflicts. Selected students receive special training to
enable them to act as third party mediators between two or more of their
peers in the same school who are involved in petty quarrels and who are
willing to have their disputes resolved constructively.

Those collaborating in the Peer Mediation programme encompass a wide
range of community and government organizations, including schools,
CDCs, namely Sembawang-Hong Kah CDC and Ang Mo Kio-Cheng San CDC, the
Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Law, the Community Mediation
Centres and the Law Society.

Care & Protection
-----------------

Duty Of Parents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Parents have a duty to provide care and protection to their children.
This includes providing a safe home environment, provision of food,
clothes and shelter. They also have a duty under law to provide for the
child’s education.

Section 68 of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353) provides that *“[e]xcept
where an agreement or order of court otherwise provides, it shall be the
duty of a parent to maintain or contribute to the maintenance of his or
her children:*

-  *Whether they are in his or her custody or the custody of any other
   person, and*

-  *Whether they are legitimate or illegitimate,*

*either by*

-  *Providing them with such accommodation, clothing, food and education
   as may be reasonable having regard to his or her means and station in
   life or*

-  *By paying the cost thereof.”*

Information For Juveniles Seeking Help Or Advice
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a child or young person requires help and advice because basic care
and protection is not provided at home, he can approach his teachers or
counsellors in school or a Family Service Centre. They may help him to
talk to his parents and help him and his parents to understand one
another.

If the problem cannot be resolved, the person whom the child or young
person can ask for help may report the case to the Ministry of Social
and Family Development (“MSF”). A social worker from the MSF will:

• Remove the child or young person from his home to a place of safety if
the worker thinks it is not safe living at home.

• Check to see whether the child or young person is being properly taken
care of at home.

• Counsel the parents and teach them how to take better care of the
child or young person, and/or

• Apply to the Juvenile Court for a Care and Protection Order if
necessary.

Role Of The Juvenile Court
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Court will act in the youth’s best interest, and may order that:

• A welfare officer supervise him/her, to ensure he/she is well taken
care of by his/her parents.

• The youth stay in a Home for boys and/or girls, or a relative or other
person who can take good care of him/her; and/or

• The youth and his/her parents to go for counselling, psychotherapy or
other programmes so as to teach them how to deal with the problems each
party faces and to teach the parents how to take better care of their
child.

The MSF social worker will contact the parents to inform them of their
legal duty to allow the youth to continue his/her studies. If necessary,
the social worker will apply for a Care and Protection Order that can
help keep the youth in school.

Domestic Violence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Family violence**

Domestic or family violence can occur in different forms. Examples
include punching, slapping, kicking, choking, hitting with objects,
issue of threats, intimidation and verbal abuse. [288]_

Under Section 64 of the Women’s Charter (Cap. 353), “family violence”
means the commission of any of the following acts:

(a) Wilfully / knowingly placing, or attempting to place, a family
member in fear of hurt.

(b) Causing hurt to a family member by such act which is known or ought
to have been known would result in hurt.

(c) Wrongfully confining or restraining a family member against his
will.

(d) Causing continual harassment with intent to cause or knowing that it
is likely to cause anguish to a family member.

Thisdoes not include any force lawfully used in self-defence, or by way
of correction towards a child below 21 years of age.

**Information for victims of family violence**

If a person or any of his family members are victim(s) of
domestic/family violence, the person should immediately:

**(a) Go to the Police for help**

The person can call the police or go to the nearest neighbourhood Police
Post or Centre for help. A police report is necessary if the person
wishes to apply for a Protection or Expedited Order. The police can
provide a referral letter to go to the hospital for medical examination
and treatment.

**(b) Go to a Family Service Centre for advice and assistance**

The person can call any of the hotlines or go to the nearest family
service centre for help or the person needs someone to talk to. There
will be people to listen and assist.

**(c) Go for a medical examination/treatment if injured**

A person should seek medical treatment at the nearest hospital or
clinic. Even if there is no wish to take action against the abuser, it
is advisable that the person go to the doctor to have his injuries
documented as evidence of the abuse.

**(d) Go to a temporary shelter if the person fears for own safety or
the safety of his family members**

**(e) Go to a crisis shelter**

If a person has to leave the home immediately due to family violence and
have no place to go, there are crisis shelters where he can stay
temporarily. The person may approach a Family Service Centre or the
Police if he wishes to go to a crisis shelter. The person can also seek
shelter with relatives or friends whom he can trust.

**(f) Go to the Family Court for a Protection Order or Expedited Order**

You can apply to the Court for:

-  A Protection Order to stop the family violence

-  An Expedited Order if there is imminent danger of family violence
   being committed against the applicant or the applicant’s family
   member.

These are “restraining orders” that forbid the abusive member from using
violence against the applicant. Not abiding by the order is a criminal
offence that can be charged in court.

A person can apply for a Protection Order / Expedited Order from the
Family Court on his own if he is 21 years old and above. If the affected
person is below 21 years old, he must get a relative who is 21 years old
or above to make the application for him.

MILITARY LAW
============

Overview of the Military Justice System
---------------------------------------

The Singapore Armed Forces (“SAF”) is expected to treat every member of
its service personnel fairly and equally under the military justice
system, regardless of race, rank or vocation. [289]_

The military justice system is based on the SAF Act (Cap 295). All
servicemen/women are subjected to the SAF Act, SAF Regulations and
orders of whatever form issued pursuant to them. While discipline is
paramount in the military, not all offences committed by SAF
servicemen/women are dealt with by formal investigations and charges.
Offenders can be dealt with by way of informal or formal punishment
systems. [290]_

Informal Punishment System [291]_
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Commanders are empowered to mete out informal punishments or
administrative measures like extra duties or weekend confinement to
servicemen who have committed minor disciplinary breaches, such as being
late, sluggish, or improperly dressed.

Unlike with formal punishment, there will be no records of informal
punishment beyond the unit’s own administration, thus such records will
not follow a Full-time National Serviceman (“NSF”) upon leaving his unit
on his Operationally-Ready Date (“ORD”).

Formal Punishment System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the offence that a serviceman/woman has committed is of a more
serious nature, he/she may be formally dealt with by his disciplinary
officer by way of a summary trial, or brought before a subordinate
military court (more commonly known as the General Court
Martial). [292]_ Depending on the rank of the serviceman/woman being
charged, he/she may be brought before a junior or senior disciplinary
officer to be charged at summary trial. The presiding officer may refer
the case to a higher authority at his/her discretion.

    **1. Summary trial**

    The offences that can be dealt with by summary trial are essentially
    military offences, such as absence without leave, non-compliance
    with lawful orders, and insubordination. [293]_

    Depending on the rank of the serviceman/woman in question, and the
    type of the disciplinary body hearing the case, the possible
    sentences that may be imposed can vary, and may include fines or
    detention. [294]_

    A summary trial lacks certain elements of a normal trial, most
    notably the absence of any requirement that the disciplinary officer
    abides by the rules of evidence. [295]_ Procedurally, it gives the
    disciplinary officer a lot of discretion in carrying out the trial
    in a manner that he/she deems appropriate or expedient for the
    disposal of the charge in conducting the trial.

    However, the discretion conferred is not a blank cheque; the summary
    trial is carried out in accordance with relevant SAF regulations,
    and the records of the summary trial are sent to the office of the
    Director, Legal Services of the SAF to monitor the conduct of such
    trials. [296]_

    **2. General Court Martial**

    The General Court Martial (“GCM”) exists as a separate forum from
    that of the summary trial. Unlike the summary trial, the GCM deals
    with a wider range of offences, and can impose a wide range of
    punishments including imprisonment and discharge, on top of
    sentences like detention and fines. The GCM is also a more public
    and open forum, and its proceedings are conducted using similar
    legal rules and procedures as those used in a civilian criminal
    court. [297]_

    Generally, only serious offences investigated by the Military Police
    Command and referred to the office of the Director of Legal Services
    will result in the accused serviceman being charged in a GCM. In
    such a case, a military prosecutor will draw up a formal charge
    sheet and present it before the GCM. [298]_

    A serviceman that has been found guilty of an offence through a
    Summary Trial will be given an opportunity to elect to be heard in a
    GCM before he is convicted and punished. [299]_ However under the
    circumstances, if the punishment for the offence is a reprimand or a
    minor punishment, the disciplinary officer has the discretion to
    refuse this opportunity to the serviceman/woman. [300]_

    **Panel Court Martial & Judge Court Martial**\  [301]_

    GCMs can be further sub-divided into two categories: the Panel
    Courts Martial—consisting of a President and usually two other
    members, and the Judge Courts Martial—consisting of a single
    President only. The current practice is for military offences to be
    heard by Panel Courts Martial, while civil offences like misuse of
    drugs and penal code offences may be dealt with by a Judge Court
    Martial.

*
*\ Seeking Redress [302]_
-------------------------

There are numerous safeguards and avenues set out in the Military
Justice System for a serviceman/women to seek redress if he/she feels
unfairly treated or sentenced.

    **1. Informal Punishment**

    Generally a serviceman/woman who is dissatisfied with an informal
    punishment may request that a superior commander review the
    punishment, or request a formal disciplinary hearing.

    **2. Summary Trial**

    **Right to be tried by a General Court Martial / Subordinate
    Military Court**

    If a Serviceman/woman is faced with a summary trial, the
    Disciplinary officer who brought the charge will first try him/her.
    One the Disciplinary officer is satisfied of the available evidence
    that the Serviceman/woman is guilty, he/she is to give the accused a
    right to be tried by a General Court Martial. However the
    Disciplinary officer has the discretion to deny trial by General
    Court Martial if the punishment is a reprimand or minor punishment
    that doesn’t involve a fine, detention, imprisonment, deduction in
    rank or any other more serious penalty.

    If the Serviceman/woman choses to exercise their right to be tried
    by General Court Martial, the Disciplinary officer shall forward the
    charge sheet, record of evidence and such other particulars to the
    director. The Director shall:

-  Direct that a charge be submitted to the convening authority and a
   trail by General Court Martial shall proceed.

-  With the approval of the Armed Forces Council, direct that no action
   be taken against the accused either by way of Summary Trial or by a
   General Court Martial, thereby acquitting ehe Serviceman/Woman of the
   charge

    **Petition for Review**

    Alternatively, an aggrieved Serviceman/Woman may request that the
    Armed Forces Council or any other appropriate authority as delegated
    by the Council review his/her conviction or punishment imposed at
    the Summary Trial.

    **3. General Court Martial**

    General Court Martial and Field General Courts Martial are
    collectively referred to as “Subordinate Military Courts”.

**Representation**

    In the case of a General Court Martial, a Serviceman/woman may
    choose to be represented by a lawyer or an SAF Defending Officer if
    a Court Martial will hear his/her Case. Accepting the appointment of
    an SAF Defending Officer incurs no cost to the Serviceman, but the
    costs of a privately engaged lawyer must be borne by the
    Serviceman/woman.

    **Petition for Review and Appeal**

    At the end of the trial, a Serviceman/woman who is dissatisfied with
    the decision of the Court Martial may petition the Reviewing
    Authority (the Armed Forces Council or a Committee of its members)
    for a review of his/her case. The Serviceman/Woman can also appeal
    to the Military Court Of Appeal (“MCA”) for a reconsideration of
    his/her conviction, his /her sentence or both. All decisions of the
    MCA are final.

    **4. Military Court Of Appeal**

**Composition of the MCA**

    The MCA is the highest court in the Military Justice System. The
    MCA, when convened to hear an appeal, sits as a aanel of five
    members. Heading the MCA is a President appointed by the Chief
    Justice. By law, the President of the MCA must be a person qualified
    to be a Judge Of The Supreme Court. Four other members—two civilian
    members who are qualified Legal Practitioners with at least five
    years experience each, and two Senior Military Officers—constitute
    the rest of the MCA.

    **Use Of Civilian Legal Procedures**

    The General Court Martial and the MCA are tribunals headed by
    Presidents who are outside the SAF chain of command. The Presidents
    of these forums will hear the case impartially like any other
    civilian criminal case. The proceedings in the General Court Martial
    and the MCA are also heard in a public forum, and these military
    courts adopt many of the same legal procedures and safeguards as
    those used in civilian criminal courts. All Servicemen/women
    formally charged with offences can bring their cases to these
    forums.

Charge Procedure
----------------

Case Flow Outline
-----------------

*
*\ Charges & Jurisdiction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**1. Accused servicemen/women under the rank of Warrant Officer**

Either a junior disciplinary officer or a senior disciplinary officer
can issue a charge and hold a summary trial. [303]_

-  A “junior disciplinary officer” is an officer or a warrant officer
   commanding a squadron, battery, company or equivalent
   sub-unit [304]_.

-  A “senior disciplinary officer” is an officer in command of a base or
   unit equivalent to a battalion or larger, usually the Commanding
   Officer of the serviceman/woman’s unit [305]_.

    The serviceman/woman may be able to elect to be tried by a General
    Court Martial (“GCM”) instead. (Refer to the previous section for
    details)

**2. Accused officers under the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel**

Only a superior commander who is at least 2 ranks above him can issue a
charge. [306]_

The superior commander can be an officer commanding a command or
formation, or designated as a superior commander for the purpose of
discipline by the Armed Forces Council. [307]_

Arrest
~~~~~~

“Arrest” includes both close arrest and open arrest. “Close Arrest”
means that the Serviceman/Woman is detained in a designated place (e.g.
detention barracks). “Open Arrest” means that he/she is still able to go
about his/her daily activities in the barracks/ship.

A Serviceman/Woman may be placed under arrest pending investigation.
During this time, he/she will be permitted access to counsel as long as
there is no prejudice to the investigative Process.

In general, a person will not be detained where the offence is not of a
serious nature. However, a person may be placed under close arrest if
he/she is likely to injure him/herself or others, suborn witnesses, has
been apprehended as being absent without leave (“Awol”), or under any
other circumstances where close arrest is deemed desirable.

*
*\ Bail
~~~~~~~

An accused person who has been detained may apply for bail, pending
investigation or appeal. [308]_ If he is successful in his application,
he will be released from detention, and entrusted to the custody of the
person who posted bail — the surety. [309]_ If the accused person
absconds, the surety is liable to forfeit the sum specified when the
bail is granted. [310]_

    **1. Application for bail**

To apply for bail, the accused must first have lodged a notice of appeal
to the Registrar of the Subordinate Military Courts. The court will then
commence a hearing of the bail application.

    **2. Surety and bond**

The accused must also have a surety who is willing to provide a bond as
a guarantee for the accused’s attendance in court.

    The court decides the value of the bond, [311]_ and the bond itself
    may take the form of an undertaking to pay, or even an actual cash
    deposit. Depending on the value of the bond, as well as the
    surrounding circumstances, a court may allow multiple sureties.

    **3. Considerations in granting bail**

Some considerations the court might take into account in granting bail
are:

-  The seriousness of the offence.

-  The severity of the punishment awarded by the GCM (in the case of an
   appeal).

-  Whether the sureties are satisfactory.

-  Previous imprisonment or detention of the accused;

-  Previous failures to appear in court;

-  Likelihood of recidivism if released on bail (particularly in AWOL
   cases); and

-  Where the accused is charged with offences of assault/offering
   violence/indecent conduct, so as to safeguard the public.

Legal Representation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A serviceman may choose to be defended either by privately engaged
counsel, or by an appointed Defending Officer. Defending Officers are
appointed, usually from within the unit, and may or may not be legally
trained.

Access to legal representation by a practitioner of the accused person’s
choice is guaranteed under the Constitution. [312]_ However, this
entitlement only arises after “a reasonable time” after arrest so as to
facilitate the investigative process. [313]_ What constitutes “a
reasonable time” is based on the circumstances of the case, [314]_ but
in general the onus is on the investigative authority to justify the
denial of access to counsel by explaining why it would be prejudicial to
the investigative process.

Requesting Reduction & Alteration Of Charges
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Representations are written memorandums to the prosecution, and are
written to persuade the prosecution to reduce the number of charges
brought against the serviceman. Representations may be written in the
same style as a mitigation plea, and are submitted well in advance of
the trial date. If you require more time to prepare for the trial (such
as for the purpose of interviewing the serviceman and writing
representations), you may request a postponement of the trial date.

Upon interviewing the accused serviceman/woman and informing him/her of
the charges, the Defending Officer/legal representative should note if
he/she would like to contest any of the charges, either because they
contain details which he/she feels are inaccurate, or if he/she is not
amenable to admitting to the charge at all. Representations can
therefore be made to the prosecution for the purpose of reducing or
altering the charges.

The Defending Officer/legal representative might want to make
representations to the prosecution especially in cases where there are
multiple charges drawn against the serviceman form a single incident, or
when the modification of a few particulars of the charge would make the
serviceman agreeable to admitting to it.

The prosecution may respond in a number of ways:

-  An agreement to withdraw a charge means that the charge will be stood
   down entirely

-  Taking a charge into consideration means that the court will not
   treat the charges individually during sentencing, but will take them
   into consideration in the judgment. This usually is conditional on
   the serviceman’s agreement to plead guilty to the charges to be taken
   into consideration.

-  Lastly, the prosecution may choose to continue with the charges, in
   which case the charges will be brought up during the trial.

Whether charges will be dropped, taken into consideration or proceeded
upon is entirely up to the discretion of the prosecutor.

Mitigation & Defence
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    **1. Mitigation**\  [315]_

Mitigation is adopted only when the accused has already pleaded guilty.
If a serviceman/woman pleads guilty, he/she essentially accepts full
admission to the charge(s) brought against him/her, and the GCM must
then decide on the appropriate sentence.

    Therefore, the main objective of a mitigating plea is to reduce the
    sentence by raising appropriate mitigating factors. These include
    previous good conduct, remorse and adverse family backgrounds.

    Besides mitigation based on existing charges, another avenue for
    reducing the overall sentence is to reduce the overall number of
    charges. This involves making representations to the prosecution.
    (Refer to Chapter 18.2.6)

    **2. Defence**

    If the accused pleads “not guilty”, the prosecution will then submit
    evidence to prove the charges. The accused may then submit a defence
    to rebut the allegations made by the prosecution. In general, a
    defence is more difficult to conduct than mitigation. Although it is
    possible for a serviceman/woman to represent him/herself, or to
    request a Defending Officer, most servicemen/women privately engage
    lawyers if they are contesting the charge.

Common Military Offences
------------------------

Commonly Asked Questions on Military Law

**Will I be charged in a civil court after being charged in a military
court?**

If you have been charged in a military court, you cannot be charged in a
civil court for the same offence or for an offence arising from the same
facts.

**Can I choose to stand trial in a civil court instead of a military
court? **

As a military charge is not a civil charge, once you have been charged
in a military court you cannot request to be charged in a civil court.

**Will I have a civil criminal record as a result of a military
charge?**

No.

If you have been charged with a military offence under the SAF Act (as
opposed to the Penal Code), the SAF will record the offence internally
but you will not have a criminal record.

**Will I be sent to the detention barracks immediately upon arrest?**

You may be detained in the detention barracks while waiting for the
court martial. The wait in detention may be counted as part of your
subsequent sentence.

**Will a military charge affect my employment or education prospects? **

In general, any military offence may be reflected in your ORD transcript
and will be viewed by potential employers and educational institutions.
Certain universities and employers may also include a request for any
conviction by a court of law including a military court.

**What happens if I can’t pay a fine imposed on me? **

If you default on a fine, you may be detained in the Detention Barracks
for a period of 10 days for a fine of $100 and below, a period of 20
days for a fine between $300 and $100 and a maximum of 40 days for
larger amounts. [316]_

**Can I work while serving in the SAF?**

NSFs can apply to their Commanding Officer for permission to work
outside of military duties provided there are pressing personal
circumstances and that such work does not conflict with military duties.

**Can my items be confiscated during a search? **

Confiscation of items can only take place when you are under arrest.
Only a military policeman who is making an arrest can confiscate your
personal items if there is reason to believe that the items were used in
the offence or are relevant evidence of the offence. Your items may be
detained until your discharge or acquittal. Any other military personnel
are only able to search for and seize offensive weapons.

**Can my parents / relatives / girlfriend visit me in the Detention
Barracks?**

Detained serviceman can only have 1 visit per week from immediate family
members only but there is no limit on the number of visits by legal
counsel or Defending Officers. You may also receive letters, and write 1
letter per week. [317]_

ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION
==============================

What Is Alternative Dispute Resolution?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alternative dispute resolution, or ADR, refers to a range of procedures
for resolving disputes between parties **outside of the traditional
court system**. These include:

+------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **ADR Procedure**            | **Description**                                                                                                                              |
+==============================+==============================================================================================================================================+
| **Arbitration**              | A person or panel selected by the parties decides the dispute after receiving evidence and hearing arguments.                                |
+------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Mediation**                | A neutral person helps the parties find a mutually acceptable resolution of their dispute.                                                   |
+------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Adjudication**             | Commercial use of an adjudicator, who is a neutral third party, to decide issues between parties.                                            |
+------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Neutral Evaluation**       | An expert identifies each side’s strengths and weaknesses and suggests the likely amount of damages, if any, that may be awarded at trial.   |
+------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Settlement Conferences**   | A judge meets with the parties to explore settlement options and encourages them to agree upon a resolution of their dispute.                |
+------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

The various ADR procedures range from non-evaluative, informal methods
such as conciliation and facilitation to more evaluative and formal
mechanisms such as arbitration and neutral evaluation.

Arbitration

Arbitration is a consensual process by which parties submit their
differences to one or more impartial persons, the arbitrator or panel of
arbitrators, for resolution through a final and binding decision.

Below are some of the key features of arbitration:

**Confidentiality:** While similar to court litigation in that
proceedings are adversarial and decisions are binding, arbitration
offers a high degree of confidentiality to parties (the proceedings are
private), more flexibility in terms of rules and procedures used as well
as greater international enforceability of judgements over court
decisions.

Under the New York Convention to which Singapore is a signatory,
arbitral awards have extra-territorial enforceability in over 120
countries.

**Time and cost saving:** Resolving disputes through arbitration instead
of litigation can sometimes save time and money for the parties
involved, as arbitral proceedings can in certain cases be faster and
more cost-efficient.

The characteristics of arbitration make it particularly suited for
commercial disputes, especially where confidentiality is important to
the parties involved. Almost every civil dispute can be referred to
arbitration.

However matters involving moral questions or questions of law cannot be
resolved by arbitration. Matters not referred to arbitration include:

(a) Matrimonial matters, like divorce or maintenance.

(b) Bankruptcy matters, eg. declaring a person as an insolvent.

(c) Criminal offences.

    Mediation

    Mediation is a non-adversarial consensual process in which a neutral
    person, the mediator, helps parties to settle their disputes through
    a conciliatory process of discussion and narrowing differences.

    Parties in mediations make their own decisions, with the help of the
    mediator in shaping the outcome of the dispute. The mediator does
    **not** have the final decision-making power. Should parties fail to
    come to an agreement, they are permitted to walk away from the
    mediation session without a positive outcome. Successful mediation
    depends on the co-operation of all parties in implementing the
    agreed upon solution, since the process (unlike arbitration) is
    non-binding unless the parties agree to be contractually bound by
    the terms of settlement.

    The focus in mediation is on finding a practical solution acceptable
    to all parties that helps to preserve the working relationship on
    all sides.

    Adjudication

    Adjudication is similar to arbitration, although there is a set
    timeframe within which the adjudicator must make a decision and
    parties are responsible for their own costs unless otherwise agreed.
    Decisions made in adjudication, as for arbitration, are binding
    unless these are later overturned by an arbitration or court
    judgment.

    Commonly used in the construction industry to ensure payment and
    resolve other types of disputes, adjudication is aimed at being
    faster and more cost effective than either litigation or
    arbitration.

    In general, the flexible nature of ADR and the various options
    available allows parties to choose the most appropriate way for
    resolving their disputes without unnecessary cost or delay.

    Neutral Evaluation

    This is a structured proceeding, but conducted informally. Both
    parties and their lawyers present their side of the case and key
    evidence to one another and the evaluator, who is a settlement
    judge.

    The evaluator then reviews the case and provides an assessment of
    the merits, which is his best estimate of the parties' likelihood of
    success at trial.

    Neutral evaluation can be used to either settle, or as a basis for
    settlement of negotiations.

    Settlement Conferences

    These are meetings in which a judge or volunteer attorney assists
    opposing parties, to reach a mutually agreeable resolution of their
    dispute without having to proceed to a trial. The judge will
    evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of the case, without making
    any decisions or orders in the case.

    Such a conference may be initiated through either party, or it may
    be ordered by the court as a precedent to holding a trial. Parties
    are usually represented at the settlement conference by their own
    lawyers.

    Alternative Dispute Resolution in Singapore

    The following section provides an overview of various ADR services
    available in Singapore to businesses and individuals.

General Commercial Disputes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**A. Mediation**

**Singapore Mediation Centre (SMC)**

Services provided by the SMC include Mediation, Neutral Evaluation,
Mediation-Arbitration ("Med-Arb") and the Singapore Domain Name dispute
resolution. Online ADR services are also available through the dispute
manager website (see section on online ADR below).

The SMC also administers the Small Case Commercial Mediation Scheme
(SCCMS), which is designed to provide cheap mediation services for cases
where the quantum of a claim is S$60,000 or less. The first two hours of
mediation are free.

Its panel of mediators and neutrals includes leaders from different
professions and industries who have undergone formal mediation training
and rigorous evaluation. SMC also has an international panel of
mediators that parties may choose from.

Fees depend on the quantum in dispute and the seniority and number of
mediators.

The SMC can be found at -

1 Supreme Court Lane, Level 4, Singapore 178879

Tel +65 6332 4366

Fax +65 6333 5085

**Mediation in the State Courts**

State Courts attempt to provide a holistic approach to dispute
resolution, including mediation, in a variety of matters -

1. **Criminal matters** - After the complainant files a summons, a
   notice may be issued for both the complainant and respondent to
   appear for mediation before a Magistrate or in the Community
   Mediation Centre.

2. **Small Claims Tribunals** - Generally, claims less than $10,000 are
   heard here. Parties normally comprise consumer and supplier, and are
   asked to attend a mediation or “consultation” session before a Small
   Claims Tribunals Registrar.

3. **Other civil matters** - Other civil disputes may be referred for
   mediation by the Primary Dispute Resolution Centre (PDRC), please see
   below for further details. The PDRC will only schedule a mediation
   session when all the pleadings – all documents required to commence
   an action or defend a case – have been filed and all the parties
   consent to the mediation.

   If the case is a non-injury motor accident (NIMA) or personal injury
   (PI), a notice to attend Court Dispute Resolution will be sent to
   your lawyer.

   If the case is not NIMA or PI, then either party may apply for
   mediation after obtaining permission of all parties.

4. **Family matters** - Parties involved in divorce proceedings in the
   Family Court may be referred for mediation in the Family Resolutions
   Chambers or the Child Focused Resolution Centre. Mediation is also
   conducted by the Maintenance Mediation Chambers when parties file
   maintenance complaints.

   *What Goes on During Mediation at the PDRC*

   **Ad Hoc Mediation**

   Parties can also arrange, for a fee, an *ad hoc* mediation through
   law firms or various other private service providers. These mediators
   will facilitate discussions between the parties to facilitate
   settlement.

   **B. Arbitration**

   **Singapore International Arbitration Centre (SIAC)**

   SIAC is an arbitral institution that offers a neutral and independent
   venue for parties to resolve their disputes. Its services include
   arbitrator appointment and case administration (including financial
   management, logistical and institutional support) to parties involved
   in commercial disputes, both domestic and international.

   With the exception of criminal and family law matters, almost any
   civil case that can be taken to court can be resolved by arbitration
   at SIAC if the parties agree. Fees charged for arbitration include a
   management fee pegged to the amount in the dispute as well as the
   arbitrator's fee, which depends on the complexity and quantum of the
   dispute as well as the seniority of the arbitrators.

   SIAC has a regional panel and an international panel of arbitrators,
   comprising of legal and industry experts in a broad range of subject
   areas. Parties are also free to appoint their own arbitrators if they
   prefer.

   **Other Arbitration Rules / Ad Hoc Arbitration**

   Parties may also agree to arbitrate in Singapore in *ad hoc*
   arbitrations or under other arbitration rules such as the ICC rules
   or UNCITRAL rules. Where parties do not use an arbitration
   institution to administer the arbitration, they will be responsible
   for organizing the arbitration.

   Where arbitration is conducted in Singapore, the Arbitration Act
   (where all the parties are domestic) and the International
   Arbitration Act (all other arbitrations) will apply.

   **Arbitration For Small Cases**

   **Small Claims Tribunal (SCT)**

   The Small Claims Tribunals was established to provide a quick and
   inexpensive forum for the resolution of small claims between
   consumers and suppliers. Claims brought before the tribunals first go
   through mediation to try to reach a settlement, failing which
   adjudication is used to resolve the dispute.

   Small Claims Tribunal can hear only (i) matters less than $10,000; or
   (ii) matters between $10,000 and $20,000, but only if all parties
   signed a memorandum of consent to have the matter heard at the SCT.

   **Law Society Arbitration Scheme (LSAS)**

   The LSAS offers neutral evaluation and arbitration services under a
   simple procedure designed to achieve a speedy resolution at low cost.

   Arbitrations with a sum in dispute of less than S$60,000 are
   ‘documents-only’ arbitrations without an oral hearing, by default,
   unless parties opt otherwise. Costs are limited to 10% of claim value
   or S$2,000, whichever is higher. A scale for party and party costs
   also applies.

   **Pro Bono Arbitration Scheme (PBAS)**

   This scheme is similarly managed by the Law Society. The PBAS is only
   for disputes of up to $20,000, and arbitrations are conducted on a
   documents-only basis.

   There is a sole arbitrator, who will waive his or her fees for the
   matter.

Industry-Specific ADR Schemes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Construction - BCA-SMC Adjudication Initiative**

The Building and Construction Industry Security of Payment (SOP) Act was
introduced with the objective of facilitating cash flow in the
construction industry by upholding the rights of parties to seek
progress payment for work done, and providing a framework for quick and
low-cost resolution of payment disputes through adjudication. The Act
applies to all parties in the construction industry with written
contracts for the works or the supply of goods or services for
construction projects in Singapore.

The Singapore Mediation Centre (SMC) has been appointed as the
Authorised Nominating Body or ANB under the Act and is tasked with
administering the adjudication process as well as train, certify and
maintain a register of adjudicators.

**Maritime - Singapore Chamber of Maritime Arbitration (SCMA)**

The SCMA offers parties involved in maritime disputes an independent,
efficient and reliable means of resolving their disputes through
arbitration. SCMA has an international panel of experienced arbitrators,
user-friendly arbitration rules and a quantum-based fee structure which
provides certainty of cost. Services provided by SCMA include
appointment of arbitrators and case administration including all
financial, logistical and administrative matters relating to the
arbitration.

**Singapore Institute of Surveyors and Valuers (SISV)**

The SISV Dispute Resolution Centre provides mediation and arbitration
services in respect of real estate and construction disputes. The
mediators on SISV's Panel of Mediators are drawn from its membership.
They comprise practising quantity surveyors, valuers and land surveyors
who are familiar with the kinds of disputes in their respective
industries. Any party to a real estate or construction dispute may
approach the SISV Mediation Centre for its dispute to be resolved
through mediation. Disputes that can be handled by SISV include those
relating to:

-  Construction contracts between developers and contractors,
       contractors and contractors.

-  The development and management of buildings including strata title
       developments.

-  The buying and selling of property and agency related disputes.

-  The surveying field, including those concerning boundary conflicts
       and encroachments.

-  The provision of professional services in the field of development,
       land surveying, construction, project management, contract
       administration, property management, valuation and property
       consultancy and other related services.

-  Other disputes relating to development, planning, construction,
       project management, valuation, property management and
       maintenance issues concerning property and projects.

   **For Disputes Between Law Practices – SCMediate**

   Senior Counsel in private practice (known as the Forum of Senior
   Counsel) have decided to make themselves available to mediate
   disputes between law practices. Under this service, every Senior
   Counsel in private practice will be available, if requested, to act
   as a mediator in any dispute between law practices. The Senior
   Counsel providing this service will not charge where the total time
   spent does not exceed half a day. However, their availability to act
   will be subject to their prior or overriding commitments. All
   communications with Senior Counsel as mediator will be kept
   confidential. Senior Counsel will render their services on the basis
   that they will be exempted from liability in respect of the services
   provided. As with all mediations, Senior Counsel will not have any
   power to make binding decisions.

   Parties may appoint a mutually agreed Senior Counsel of their choice
   as mediator.

   This scheme is different from the Cost Dispute Resolve scheme offered
   by the society for resolving disputes on legal costs.

Social, Community & Relational Disputes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Community Mediation Centres (CMCs)**

The purpose of the CMC is to provide mediation services in social,
community or family disputes that do not involve a seizable offence
(where police are legally empowered to arrest without a warrant).

CMCs handle cases involving conflicts between neighbours, family members
and friends. CMCs cater to community disputes as opposed to commercial
ones. These encompass relational disputes encountered within one's
community and social sphere. Parties to:

-  Neighbourhood disputes

-  Family disputes (excluding family violence)

-  Disagreements with friends

-  Stallholder/owner squabbles and

-  Altercations/arguments between strangers

   can approach the Community Mediation Centres. Staff will evaluate the
   suitability of each case for mediation.

   Apart from direct intake cases, the CMCs also handle Magistrate
   Complaint referrals from the State Courts pursuant to section 15 of
   the CMCs Act. CMCs have also worked with other frontline agencies
   such as family service centres, community centres and the police to
   set up satellite mediation venues at suitable locations near to where
   Singaporeans live and work.

   **Other Mediation and Counselling Centres**

   Mediation work for family and community-related issues is also
   undertaken by non-profit organisations in Singapore. For example, the
   Eagles Mediation and Counselling Centre (EMCC) conducts community
   mediation and counseling programmes for individuals, families, youths
   and organisations.

**Mediation in Family and Divorce Matters, Ministry of Community
Development, Youth and Sports (MCYS)**

Mediation is also used to resolve disputes in the Tribunal of
Maintenance of Parents (TMP) and the Syariah Court under MCYS.

The ***TMP*** provides a legal avenue for elderly parents to apply for a
maintenance order against their children. When a case is brought to the
TMP, the Tribunal first refers parties to a conciliation officer for
mediation, to try to help them arrive at a settlement.

In the ***Syariah Court***, mediation is also used to help married
couples of the Muslim faith in filing for divorce issues such as the
custody of children, division of matrimonial property and other divorce
and ancillary issues. This helps the couple to maintain ties and
continue to communicate after the divorce for the sake of their
children.

THE TRAFFIC COURT
=================

The Traffic Court hears and tries traffic offences. It deals with all
fresh traffic arrest cases, Traffic Police summonses/notices where there
are no offers of composition as well as Land Transport Authority
summonses/notices where there are no offers of composition.

It operates as a mentions court which deals with a wide variety of
applications including applications for bail, remand and adjournments
and is involved in the management of traffic cases. It is also the trial
court for traffic cases.

Traffic offences *without* any offer of composition
---------------------------------------------------

If there is no offer of composition, you are required to attend the
Traffic Court on the date and time stipulated. Once you have been dealt
with by the Traffic Court, you will be given either a fine ticket (blue
in colour) or a Fine Advice Chit by the Court Officer. You can make the
payment at the Finance Section which is located at Level one of the
State Courts, Havelock Square Complex.

Minor traffic offences *with* an offer of composition
-----------------------------------------------------

A traffic offence is considered minor if there is an offer of
composition stated on the traffic ticket or notice. There is an offer of
composition if the ticket or notice states a sum of money which you can
pay to settle the ticket or notice without going to court.

**AXS Stations:** Anyone who receives a traffic ticket or notice from
the Traffic Police Department, Land Transport Authority, Housing and
Development Board or Urban Redevelopment Authority for a minor traffic
offence may use the AXS Station to settle the fine.

If the offer of composition has expired, users can use the Automated
Traffic Offence Management System (ATOMS) to settle their tickets or
notices by pleading guilty to the traffic offence stated in their ticket
or notice and pay a court fine. With ATOMS, users can settle their
traffic tickets at their convenience and there is no need to go to
court.

ATOMS is run on the AXS Stations which are located island-wide. You can
call the AXS Hotline at 6560 2727 or visit their website at
http://www.axs.com.sg to find the AXS Station nearest to you.

Please note that the operating hours for the AXS Hotline are:

8.00 am to 10.00 pm daily

(including Sundays and public holidays)

**
**\ Commonly Asked Questions on the Traffic Court
-------------------------------------------------

**Can I claim legal aid for a traffice offence?**

Yes, it is possible but not guaranteed, as there are rules on
eligibility for free legal aid, depending on the individual lawyer/ law
firm or other organization you approach in regards to your case.

**Should I hire a lawyer, or can I represent myself in Court?**

This depends on whether your traffic offence is a minor or serious one.

Your traffic ticket/notice will indicate whether your traffic offence is
serious or minor. If the ticket specifies an “offer of composition”,
your offence is considered minor. You can pay a “composition” to settle
the ticket/notice without going to court (thus, you do not have to hire
counsel), provided you pay on time.

If there is no offer of composition, your offence is considered serious.
You must attend court on the appointed date. If you plead guilty, the
court will impose a sentence. If you claim trial, a date will be set for
the case to be heard. [318]_

**On what grounds can my licence be suspended/revoked?**

Singapore's demerit points system named the Driver Improvement Points
System (DIPS) was introduced on 1 March 1983. DIPS is designed to
identify and rehabilitate errant drivers through a system of rewards and
punishments. Errant motorists are thus encouraged to improve their
driving behaviours on the roads with incentives to expunge their demerit
points and previous suspension record as well as remission of suspension
period.

For new motorists who are *under one year of probation* from the date of
grant on their dirving licence, the driving licence can be revoked and
become invalid when 13 or more demerit points are accumulated. The
licence holder will have to retake all necessary tests to obtain a
licence again.

For *non-probation motorists*, where they have no previous suspension
record with Traffic Police, and they have accumulated 24 or more demerit
points within 24 consecuive months, their driving licence will become
liable for the 1\ :sup:`st` suspension of 12 weeks. If a motorists has a
previous suspension record with Traffice Police, and they have
accumulated 12 or more demerit points within 12 months, their driving
lience will become liable for the subsequent suspension. For subsequent
suspensions after the 1\ :sup:`st` suspension, the suspension periods
are:

-  2\ :sup:`nd` suspension: 24 weeks

-  3\ :sup:`rd` suspension: 1 year

-  4\ :sup:`th` suspension: 2 years

-  5\ :sup:`th` suspension (onwards): 3 years

Where the suspension period lasts a year or longer (ie. 3\ :sup:`rd`
suspension and onwards), the driving licence will be revoked and become
invalid. The licence holder will have to retake all the necessary
driving tests (theory and practical) to obtain a licence to drive/ride
again.

Motorists liable for 1\ :sup:`st` and 2\ :sup:`nd` suspension will offer
a retraining course to correct their driving beaviours. If they take and
pass the retraining course, their suspension period will be given a
remission. For 1st suspension, the suspension period will be reduced
from 12 weeks to 4 weeks. If none of their traffic offences leading to
their 1st suspension was involved in traffic accident, their suspension
period will be further reduced to 1 week; and for 2nd suspension, it
will be reduced from 24 weeks to 12 weeks.

There is no offer of retraining course and remission for 3rd and
subsequent suspensions.

**What are the offences listed under DIPS?**

Under the DIPS, demerit points are given from a list of scheduled
offences under the Road Traffic (DIPS) Rules.

** **

**What do I do if issued with a warrant of arrest?**

If you have settled all your traffic summonses, and would like to find
out why there is a warrant of arrest issued against you, you can send an
email to: SPF\_TP\_Summons\_Processing@spf.gov.sg or call (65) 6 547
0000 to check.

*Warrants are typically issued when a person fails to appear in court or
is being sought on criminal charges.* It is best to consult a criminal
lawyer for advice on how to possibly avoid being locked up, and not less
importantly, to prepare for your defense.

The Warrant will be handed over to the Warrant Enforcement Unit (a
division of the Singapore Police Force) or the respective enforcement
agencies for them to execute. The police will either arrest you or you
may be asked to surrender yourself at the Warrant Enforcement Unit for
the warrant to be executed.

As a condition of the Warrant of Arrest, bail may or may not be offered
upon arrest. If no bail is offered, you will be brought to Court within
48 hours of your arrest; if bail is offered, you will be asked to
furnish the bail sum before you may be released to attend Court on a
specified date. If you are unable to find a bailor, you will be brought
to Court within 48 hours of your arrest. In certain cases, you may be
disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence pending your
arrest.

**How can I get a charge withdrawn?**

If you in fact committed the offence charged against you, there is no
way that the charge can be withdrawn completely. However, if you feel
that you did not commit the offence, or that the summons was not
justifiable, you may make an appeal by writing to the Traffic Police or
LTA. [320]_

**Traffic Police appeals**

Write to: Chief Investigation Officer Violation Reports Investigation
Branch, Traffic Police Department, 10 Ubi Avenue 3, Singapore 408865 

Email:
`*SPF\_TP\_Summons\_Processing@spf.gov.sg* <mailto:SPF_TP_Summons_Processing@spf.gov.sg>`__

**LTA appeals**

Write to:
`*https://vrl.lta.gov.sg/lta/vrl/action/pubfunc?ID=AddAppeal* <https://vrl.lta.gov.sg/lta/vrl/action/pubfunc?ID=AddAppeal>`__

**Can the number of charges against me be reduced?**

If you think you have a good reason for committing the offence, you can
try to mitigate the offence. Use an `*AXS
station* <http://www.axs.com.sg/axsStation_locations.php>`__ and answer
“Yes” when asked if you want to mitigate the offence. You will be
required to attend a court hearing and explain your reasons to the
judge. [321]_

Commonly Asked Questions on Handphone Driving [322]_

For the offence of handphone driving to stand, **ALL** the following 3
conditions must be fulfilled:

    (1) The vehicle is in motion

    (2) The driver is holding on to the handphone with one hand; while
    his other hand is holding the steering wheel

    (3) The driver is communicating with any person with that handphone

**Note:** If the driver is not holding on to the steering wheel at all,
he can be charged for reckless or dangerous driving. Upon conviction,
first-time offenders can be fined up to S$3000/-, or jailed for a term
up to 12 months, or both. Repeat offenders are liable for a maximum fine
of S$5000/-, or to imprisonment for a term up to 2 years, or both. In
addition, they may also be disqualified from holding or obtaining a
driving licence. This includes making phone calls, paging someone,
receiving a call by pressing the keypad, and reading, writing or sending
an SMS.

**Purpose of the rules:** The purpose of setting the three conditions is
to ensure that drivers who have no intention to commit handphone driving
will not be caught by ambiguous rules. For example, a driver who simply
holds a mobile phone but is not using it to communicate while driving
will not have committed the offence. However, if by doing so, the driver
loses attention on the roads and fails to maintain proper control of his
vehicle, he will still have committed an offence of driving without due
care or reasonable consideration.

Similarly, the spirit of the law is such that the driver who uses his
handphone is only a menace to other road users if his vehicle is moving.
Hence, drivers who use their handphones while their vehicles are
stationary will not be caught.

In short, Traffic Police do not take action against motorists for
handphone driving simply because there is a handphone on the passenger
seat or beside the driver. Traffic Police will only take action when our
observations show that all the three conditions for the offence of
handphone driving are concurrently present.

All handphone driving offenders will be prosecuted in court, regardless
of whether the motorist is a first-timer or repeat offender. A
first-timer convicted of phone and drive offence shall be liable to 12
demerit points and a maximum fine of up to $1000/- or to imprisonment
for a term not exceeding 6 months or both. He/She may also be
disqualified from driving. The offender's handphone and SIM card will be
seized to facilitate investigation. These may be forfeited by the court
upon conviction.

**Common Scenarios:**

**Scenario A (Paging for someone):** Page for someone, with or without
earpiece, using one hand to hold on to the mobile phone while driving.

**Scenario B (SMS/MMS message):** Writing, Sending, and Reading SMS/MMS
messages from someone, with or without earpiece, using one hand to hold
on to the mobile phone while driving.

**Scenario C (Making a Call):** Making a call, with or without earpiece,
by pressing the keypads and was holding handphone in one hand while
driving.

**Scenario D (Receiving a Call):** Receiving a call, with or without
earpiece, by pressing the keypads and was holding handphone in one hand
while driving.
